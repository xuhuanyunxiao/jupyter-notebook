Recai Berber, member of\\xa0Turkish parliament from\\xa0the ruling Justice and Development Party and chairman of\\xa0the parliamentary Turkish-Russian Friendship Group, has recalled that Ankara decided to\\xa0purchase the S-400 systems after\\xa0holding talks and reaching relevant agreements with\\xa0all its allies.\\n\"Consequently, we know that this decision cannot contradict our membership in NATO and allied relations with\\xa0the United States. Within the framework of\\xa0the agreement on\\xa0S-400, it is also a matter of\\xa0technology exchange between\\xa0Russia and Turkey. So NATO allies opposing it is out\\xa0of the question,\" Berber said.\\n\\n                        ©\\n                    Sputnik/ Alexey MalgavkoUS May Sanction Turkey Following Purchase of Russian S-400 Systems - ReportsHe pointed to \"contradictory messages to\\xa0the public \" issued by\\xa0the US State Department, the Pentagon and the US President, which he said led to\\xa0the situation when \"neither we nor the international community can understand which of\\xa0the messages reflects the true will of\\xa0the US Administration.\"\\nAccording to\\xa0him, the State Department’s statement was made without\\xa0any consultations given that positions on\\xa0the matter \"have already been clearly defined by\\xa0Turkey and NATO.\"\\n\"We have no doubt about\\xa0the purchase of\\xa0the S-400. Turkey adopted a relevant decision and clinched an agreement to\\xa0further develop the entire subsequent process. Such a statement by\\xa0the US State Department does not oblige Turkey to\\xa0anything,\" Berber emphasized.\\nHe was echoed by\\xa0Beyazıt Karatas, retired Major-General of\\xa0the Turkish Air Force, who specifically cited Ankara’s current \"sharp anti-American stance.\"\\n\"The US has repeatedly put obstacles to\\xa0Turkey’s attempts to\\xa0purchase long-range air defense systems. However, taking a decision on\\xa0the S-400, due to\\xa0be used separately from\\xa0NATO to\\xa0provide Turkey’s national security, Ankara made a meticulous long-term assessment of\\xa0the situation,\" Karatas noted.\\nHe recalled that the US continues to\\xa0exert all sorts of\\xa0pressure on\\xa0Turkey in\\xa0order to\\xa0prevent it from\\xa0purchasing the S-400 systems. According to\\xa0him, the main question is \"what steps the US will take regarding Ankara’s purchase of\\xa0these systems from\\xa0Russia.\"\\nREAD MORE: What’s Behind NATO’s Decision to\\xa0Accept Turkey’s Russian S-400 Purchase\\nCiting \"the political and military situation\", Karatas suggested that the US will be unable to\\xa0keep Turkey from\\xa0buying the S-400.\\n\"The US has lost support in\\xa0Turkey, both politically and socially, as\\xa085 percent of\\xa0the Turkish public supports the anti-American and anti-NATO stance. I believe that amid the ongoing Afrin military operation and Ankara’s further actions in\\xa0Syria as\\xa0part of\\xa0anti-terror fight, Turkey will not change its decision on\\xa0the purchase of\\xa0the S-400,\" he concluded.\\n\\n                        ©\\n                    REUTERS/ Mahmoud HebboAfrin Tensions: US Warns Turkey Against Actions on Syrian Kurds as Ankara Insists on Right to Self-DefenseEarlier this week, the US State Department threatened to\\xa0slap \"appropriate measures\" against\\xa0those countries which are willing to\\xa0agree with\\xa0Russia on\\xa0buying the S-400 systems.\\nIn September 2017, Moscow and Ankara clinched a deal on\\xa0the delivery of\\xa0the S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to\\xa0Turkey. Later that month, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Kozhin confirmed Turkey’s up-front payment for\\xa0the S-400s, saying that the delivery is scheduled for\\xa02019.\\nThe agreement caused uproar in\\xa0Washington, prompting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to\\xa0underscore that his country was free to\\xa0make independent decisions about\\xa0its national security.\\nThe views and opinions expressed by\\xa0Recai Berber and Beyazıt Karatas are those of\\xa0the speakers and do not necessarily reflect Sputnik’s position.'"

So NATO allies opposing it is out\\xa0of the question,\" Berber said.\\n\\n                        ©\\n                    Sputnik/ Alexey MalgavkoUS May Sanction Turkey Following Purchase of Russian S-400 Systems - ReportsHe pointed to \"contradictory messages to\\xa0the public \" issued by\\xa0the US State Department, the Pentagon and the US President, which he said led to\\xa0the situation when \"neither we nor the international community can understand which of\\xa0the messages reflects the true will of\\xa0the US Administration.\"\\nAccording to\\xa0him, the State Department’s statement was made without\\xa0any consultations given that positions on\\xa0the matter \"have already been clearly defined by\\xa0Turkey and NATO.\"\\n\"We have no doubt about\\xa0the purchase of\\xa0the S-400. Turkey adopted a relevant decision and clinched an agreement to\\xa0further develop the entire subsequent process. Such a statement by\\xa0the US State Department does not oblige Turkey to\\xa0anything,\" Berber emphasized.\\nHe was echoed by\\xa0Beyazıt Karatas, retired Major-General of\\xa0the Turkish Air Force, who specifically cited Ankara’s current \"sharp anti-American stance.\"\\n\"The US has repeatedly put obstacles to\\xa0Turkey’s attempts to\\xa0purchase long-range air defense systems. However, taking a decision on\\xa0the S-400, due to\\xa0be used separately from\\xa0NATO to\\xa0provide Turkey’s national security, Ankara made a meticulous long-term assessment of\\xa0the situation,\" Karatas noted.\\nHe recalled that the US continues to\\xa0exert all sorts of\\xa0pressure on\\xa0Turkey in\\xa0order to\\xa0prevent it from\\xa0purchasing the S-400 systems. According to\\xa0him, the main question is \"what steps the US will take regarding Ankara’s purchase of\\xa0these systems from\\xa0Russia.\"\\nREAD MORE: What’s Behind NATO’s Decision to\\xa0Accept Turkey’s Russian S-400 Purchase\\nCiting \"the political and military situation\", Karatas suggested that the US will be unable to\\xa0keep Turkey from\\xa0buying the S-400.\\n\"The US has lost support in\\xa0Turkey, both politically and socially, as\\xa085 percent of\\xa0the Turkish public supports the anti-American and anti-NATO stance. I believe that amid the ongoing Afrin military operation and Ankara’s further actions in\\xa0Syria as\\xa0part of\\xa0anti-terror fight, Turkey will not change its decision on\\xa0the purchase of\\xa0the S-400,\" he concluded.\\n\\n                        ©\\n                    REUTERS/ Mahmoud HebboAfrin Tensions: US Warns Turkey Against Actions on Syrian Kurds as Ankara Insists on Right to Self-DefenseEarlier this week, the US State Department threatened to\\xa0slap \"appropriate measures\" against\\xa0those countries which are willing to\\xa0agree with\\xa0Russia on\\xa0buying the S-400 systems.\\nIn September 2017, Moscow and Ankara clinched a deal on\\xa0the delivery of\\xa0the S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to\\xa0Turkey. Later that month, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Kozhin confirmed Turkey’s up-front payment for\\xa0the S-400s, saying that the delivery is scheduled for\\xa02019.\\nThe agreement caused uproar in\\xa0Washington, prompting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to\\xa0underscore that his country was free to\\xa0make independent decisions about\\xa0its national security.\\nThe views and opinions expressed by\\xa0Recai Berber and Beyazıt Karatas are those of\\xa0the speakers and do not necessarily reflect Sputnik’s position.',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW (AFP) - Moscow on Saturday (Feb 3) denounced the \"bellicose\" and \"anti-Russian\" nature of new US nuclear policy, warning it would take necessary measures to ensure its own security.\\n\"The bellicose and anti-Russian nature of this document is obvious,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that it was \"deeply disappointed\".\\nThe Pentagon on Friday revealed plans to revamp its nuclear arsenal, largely in response to Russian actions in recent years.\\nThe so-called Nuclear Posture Review, released on Friday, outlines the Pentagon’s nuclear ambitions under President Donald Trump and is the first time since 2010 that the military has spelled out how it foresees nuclear threats in the coming decades.\\nWhile the document underscores the administration’s concerns about North Korea, Iran and China, the focus falls largely on Russia.\\n\"This is a response to Russian expansion of their capability and the nature of their strategy and doctrine,\" Defence Secretary James Mattis wrote in the introduction to the 75-page document.\\n\"These developments, coupled with Russia’s seizure of Crimea and nuclear threats against our allies, mark Moscow’s decided return to Great Power competition,\" he also wrote.\\nThe Pentagon worries Russia assumes America’s regular, large-yield weapons are essentially too big to ever be detonated, as their use would likely result in large-scale retaliation and wipe much of humanity off the map.\\n\"There are strong indications that our current strategy posture and capabilities are perceived by the Russians as potentially inadequate to deter them,\" Mr Greg Weaver, the deputy director of strategic capabilities for the military’s Joint Staff, told reporters.\\n\"The US and Nato require a wider range of credible low-yield nuclear options to do a very specific thing: to convince the Russian leadership that if they initiate limited nuclear use, in a war with the alliance, our response will deny them the objective they seek and impose costs that far outweigh those benefits they can achieve,\" he added.\\nThe document, an earlier version of which was leaked last month, says that by having more, smaller nukes the Pentagon can counter adversaries’ \"misperceptions\" that the United States would not respond to another country using its own low-yield bomb.']"
