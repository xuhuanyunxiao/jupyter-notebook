       " u'\\n\\nThere was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results\\nof a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  I saw another\\nfigure that listed 2% as the figure.  Of course, even if it were 99%\\nthat would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior.\\nHow many people have commited other acts of fornication?  How many\\npeople have lied or sinned in other ways?\\n\\n\\nWhy isn\\'t it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes\\n\"men with men working that which is unseemly\" to describe the acts.  \\nSure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other\\nsins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins\\nsprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of \\nman\\'s not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their\\nacts were shameless.\\n\\n\\nIs everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament?\\nScripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the\\nSpirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also\\nprotects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a\\ntwo edged sword that cuts both ways.  \\n\\nI think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.  \\nIf the Law is reflection of God\\'s character and true holy nature, then\\nthose who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  \\nIf homosexuality were \"natural\" (whatever that means) wholesome, \\nendorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded\\nbiggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of\\nit in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other\\nsex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this\\nlaw was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that\\nthis was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty\\ncrime!  \\n\\nIs every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at\\nI Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a\\nlaw not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father\\'s\\nwife.  There is a prohibition against having your father\\'s wife in \\nLeviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides\\nthis one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting\\nadultery, etc.- he spoke against having one\\'s father\\'s wife.  \\n\\nNotice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned\\nin the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan \\ncoustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact\\ntaking one\\'s father\\'s wife wasn\\'t even done among the Gentiles.  It was\\njust a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or\\nnot.\\n\\n\\nOne of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\\nis because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can\\nbe tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is\\nhomosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,\\nlike lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of\\nthe opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.\\nGod is greater than all of it. \\n\\nAnother reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural\\npower of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many \\npeople have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there\\nmay be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.\\nThat is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not\\nGod\\'s willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that\\nuses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to\\nchange them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other\\nsin.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul\\'s dealings with\\npastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order\\nto spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it\\nwas just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.\\nPaul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with\\neating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty\\nto eat meat in order to spare others.  \\n\\nBut Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to\\ntough.  Paul wrote to \"make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts\\nthereof.\"  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we\\nshould sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.\\n\\nSuppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  \\nSince others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul\\'s approach\\non pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should \\nsacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a\\nmember of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual\\n\"marriage\") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered \\na more damaging sin.\\n\\n\\nYet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something\\nthat God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.\\n\\n\\nActually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.\\nAfter he fell he would have to toil over the ground.\\n\\n\\nThat is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious\\nposition to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our\\nminds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just\\nlike anyone else.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this \\nconclusion.  It\\'s like saying, \"How should I kill myself, with gun or\\naresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to\\nsleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,\\nor all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?\\nWould it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  \\n\\nIn all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher\\nthe chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with \\nphysical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all \\nleads to spiritual death.\\n\\n\\nThe issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the\\nactual act.  Second, isn\\'t it historical snobbery to say that\\nonly homosexuals of this century are capable of having \"loving\\nrelationships?\"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual \"love.\"\\n(btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.

       " u'[some deletions]\\n\\nWell, we agree on the last part.:-)  One of the basic things you need to \\nhave in a statistic to be able to predict a player\\'s performance on it\\nin the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  A \\nplayer\\'s batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.\\nA player\\'s ability to walk or infielder\\'s Defensive Average are correlated\\nbetter.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics\\nwe can have a pretty good handle on how they\\'ll do next year.  Put in \\nsome simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of \\nthe basic problems with something like \"clutch\" batting average - overall\\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \\nAdding to the sample size doesn\\'t seem to help much.  As a counterexample to \\nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n\\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n \\nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n\\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\nsituations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\\nmeasure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \\n\\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the\\n96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88,\\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \\nabove in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,\\nyou\\'d expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The\\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\\nis not statisically significant.\\n\\nBTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\\n(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\n\\nActually, it\\'s technically incorrect to say that we can\\'t predict future\\nclutch performance.  It\\'s more correct to say that we can\\'t predict\\nfuture clutch performance with any skill.\\n\\nHarold',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nThere are several reasons for this difference.  The main reason is that\\ngood hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull)\\nare rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a\\nplace to put aging veterans.\\n\\nAnother use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury\\nslowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the\\nfield.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did\\nduring the rest of the season.\\n\\nA third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first\\nor the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  Reggie\\nJackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he\\nhit like the old Reggie when he was in right.\\n\\nThe second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by\\ntheir primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60\\nat DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.\\n\\n\\nThis makes sense; you might also look at it another way.  Although the\\n*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left\\nfielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly\\nlower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job\\nanywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.\\n\\n\",\n",

I can\\'t.\\n: \\n: And when I claim to \"repent\" of someone else\\'s sin, am I not in fact\\n: _judging_ him?  Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us\\n: not to judge people. \"Judge not that ye be not judged.\"\\n: \\n: C. S.

He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down\\ncondemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove\\nthe log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother\\'s.  But\\nHe also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don\\'t forget that this is a command\\ntoo.\\n\\nOur problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were\\nrebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the\\nexcuse that we don\\'t want to judge anyone.\\n\\nIn truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more\\nand to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin\\nwhat it is and do so openly.

       " u'\\n\\nPoint 1:\\n\\nI\\'m beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole\\n\"yeast issue\" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings\\nof words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I\\'m fully\\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\\notherwise don\\'t see much of in their practice except for the occasional\\n\"difficult\" patient.\\n\\nPoint 2:\\n\\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\\na treatment point-of-view.\\n\\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\\n\\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\\nfrom them.\\n\\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I\\'m\\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\\n\\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.\\nJust my \\'NF\\' leanings, I guess.  :^)\\n\\nComments?\\n\\nJon Noring\\n\\n-- \\n\\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.',\n",

       " u'(This is a continuation of an earlier post)\\n\\n\\n(I am sorry you found this offensive.  It was not my intent to offend.  I was \\nleading up to another point, which I discuss in more detail below.)\\n\\n\\nI can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for \\nhomosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of \\nbestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask \\nthis gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people\\'s sexual preferences?  \\nWhat happened to \"No doubt I am free to do anything\"?  I think you have a \\nserious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between \\nhomosexuality and bestiality as \"slimey\" and \"sleazy\", you are making an \\nimplicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, \\nunnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about \\nhomosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any \\nsincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even \\nhave their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them \\nall of being mere \"jokers\"?\\n\\nI notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only \\nBiblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical \\nprohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament \\npassages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none \\nthat condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian \\nhomosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any \"clear\" New Testament \\nstatements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian \\nzoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament \\nmakes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?\\n\\nI am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically \\nacceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply \\nthe same standards to everyone else\\'s declared sexual preferences as well.  If \\nthe arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual \\npreferences as well, I\\'m going to apply them and see what comes up.  I\\'m not \\ntrying to \"torpedo a serious issue\" by using what you label \"a ridiculous \\njoke\".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines \\nfor Christian sexuality, and I don\\'t think such a question is \"irrelevant\" in a \\ngroup called \"soc.religion.christian\".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and \\nbestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good \\nprecedent for doing the same.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a \\nside issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging \\npeople to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine \\nwhether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New \\nTestament that \"God has joined together\" heterosexual couples, and that the \\nmarriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual \\nintercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under \\nthe Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards \\nof defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the \\nsexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don\\'t think it\\'s \\nright to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to \\nChristians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn\\'t.  \\nThat was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different \\nexamples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong \\nto apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. \\n\\n\\nIt was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don\\'t \\nget all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual \\norientation; I\\'m afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar \\nattitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with \\nchild abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of \"clear\" NT \\ncondemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation \\n(or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on \\nalt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.\\n\\n\\nThis is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere \\nrhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the \\nanswer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you \\nyourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find \\nbestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in \\nconnection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply \\nall the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply \\nthem to homosexuals?\\n\\nIs it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at \\nthe thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of \\nhomosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially \\nunacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  \\nDo you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual \\nmorality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible \\ncondemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality \\nthan it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality \\nwith homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer \\nthis question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many \\npeople feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.\\n\\nAlso please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely \\npointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that \\nthe Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think \\nadultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love \\nmy neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and \\nunmentionable, are you disobeying \"repeated orders not to judge or condemn \\nothers\"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you \\nand judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same \\noffense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible \\nbrands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus \\nis the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I \\nagree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our \\nsalvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, \\nand we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ\\'s grace mean that those \\nwho refer to sin as \"sin\" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking \\nin general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible \\ncalls something \"sin\", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it \\nsin too.\\n\\nAs applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on \\nChristian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible \\nsays on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every \\nverse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and \"unclear\" at best.  \\nThe most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some \\ndispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as \\ncondemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most \\npositive thing you can say about the Bible\\'s treatment of homosexuality is that \\nsome verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That\\'s it.  Jesus declared all foods \\nclean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to \\nkeep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from \\nbeing an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian \\npractice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination \\nthat defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you \\nhave some verses which are at best \"not clear\" but which some people believe \\n*are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that\\'s the sum \\ntotal of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.\\n\\nI can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything \\nsimple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and \\nthose-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your \\ncase as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don\\'t believe it says \\nanything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving \\none another, and not judging one another, but that\\'s not really the issue, is \\nit?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for \\nChristians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  \\nTherefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  \\nEven if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still \\nleft with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about \\nhomosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who \\nare under the law and those who are not.\\n\\n- Mark\\n',\n",

       " u'I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\\n\\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\\n\\nNAME\\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\\n\\nDESCRIPTION\\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\\n\\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  Current features include\\n\\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\\n\\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o Performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o Converts image formats.\\n\\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\\n\\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o Modify an individual pixel\\'s RGB values.\\n\\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\\n      o  CompuServ GIF\\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\\n      o  TIFF\\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\\n\\nHardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nWhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\\n   where xxx is the version number.

       " u'\\n\\nDiplomatic :-)\\n\\nI realize I\\'m fighting Occam\\'s razor in this argument, so I\\'ll try to\\nexplain why I feel a mind is necessary. \\n\\nFirstly, I\\'m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They\\'re\\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\\nat working out the method itself.\\n\\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \\'obfuscate\\' the trick, and\\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\\nmaterial, much of which isn\\'t used.\\n\\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \\'if you see\\nobject X, then perform action Y,\\' and we don\\'t seem to get anywhere.\\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\\nconclusions to draw from it\\'s experience.\\n\\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\ncode?\\n\\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n\\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\\ncomputer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\nequivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\nwe see colour?\\n\\n\\n\\nA bit of idle speculation...\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\\n\\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\'), is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation\\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\\n\\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\'),\\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\\n\\'measurement\\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\\nchange the wavefunction.\\n\\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something\\nelse,\\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X.\\' It seems reasonable\\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\\nwavefunction.

       " u'John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:\\n\\n * \"The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *\\n *  treated as a matter of faith.\" -- Francis Hitching                     *\\n\\n  I have a few points to make about the above posting.\\n\\n    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of \"quotes\" from either\\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\\n    not be your real intent.\\n\\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of \"the modern theory of\\n    evolution\" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\\n\\n\\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\\n\\n * Neither I, nor Webster\\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\\n\\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings\\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (\"The Neck of\\nthe Giraffe\").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a \"non sequitur\" (i.e.\\nthe conclusion \"does not follow\"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\\n\\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\\ntitled \"`Giraffe\\' sticks scientific neck out too far\".  Excerpts include :\\n\\n  \"Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.\"  \"He goes after Darwin like Mark\\n  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and\\n  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.\"  \"He suggests\\n  a mystical `organizing principle\\' of life, using the similarity of organs\\n  in different creatures as evidence [sic].\"\\n\\n  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not\\nagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn\\'t\\nsurprise me much.  It\\'s also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.\\nhe only posted a quote).\\n',\n",

Multiple graphs (of the same or\\n  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\\n  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\\n  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\\n  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\\n  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\\n  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\\n  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\\n  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\\n  \\n  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\\n  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\\n  \\n  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\\n  \\n  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\\n  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\\n  \\n  Authors: Many.

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\\n\\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\\n\\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\\n---------------------------\\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\\n  hues, color range and mask.\\n\\nImageStudio: Don\\'t know...\\n\\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\\n\\nDapple Systems\\n--------------\\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\\n\\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse.

Some of\\nthese crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy\\ncancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different\\neffects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than\\none drug at a time.\\n\\nSome chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle\\nof a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.\\n\\nThe first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis\\nand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.\\nThe third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized \\naagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.\\n\\nThere are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.\\nOthers stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.\\nAt any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells\\nto stop growing.\\n\\nIf what you are seeking is \"practical\" advice, I apologize for rambling\\non the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs\\nare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to \\nexperience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small\\nfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter\\nknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines\\ntthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications \\ncan be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.\\n\\nProbably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always\\nhappen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person \\nthemself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different\\nside effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug\\nheadband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably\\nby reducing blood flow to the scalp.

The absence of CD4 \\nbinding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added \\nsafety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, \\nstimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune \\nfunction.

In the Lancet\\'s March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg\\'s  \\nhypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to \\nAIDS, \"a hindrance to public health initiatives.\"   However, their hypothesis \\nthat HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  \\nThe U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, \\nno prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this \\nhypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  \\ndepletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies \\nagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals \\nfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg\\'s drug-\\nAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-\\nfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  \\nuse altogether.  To refute Duesberg\\'s hypothesis Schechter would  have to \\nproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years \\nHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same \\nAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.

Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  \\nThe researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with \\nhepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  \\nprofound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the \\nobservation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had \\ncirculating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the \\nend of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, \\ncontained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  \\naminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, \\nhomologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  \\nThese autoantibodies, which also  recognize \"native\" class II molecules and \\nmay contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells \"in vivo\", were at low tires \\n(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  \\nautoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and \\nHCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss \\nin some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful \\n\"autoimmune\" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA \\nantigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell \\ncounts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.

About 40 percent of infected New York City \\nresidents don\\'t  complete therapy.

Gill\\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\\n\\nDate: 93/5/16\\n\\n\\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\\'ve ever downloaded\\nimages from BBS or the net, you\\'ve probably noticed (with most image\\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\\n(or the lack of it).\\n\\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\\n\\nWhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\\n\\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\\nin the HSV controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).',\n",

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \\ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \\nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \\ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \\nvisual impairment \\n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \\nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \\ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \\ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \\nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \\n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \\nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \\nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \\n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \\nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \\nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \\nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \\nYancoooulos, Regeneron\\'s Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \\nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \\nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \\nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \\nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \\nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \\nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \\nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \\nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \\n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron\\'s Director of \\nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF\\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \\nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \\nand for retinal detachment.

It is possible that BDNF \\ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \\nsurgically.\" \\n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \\nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \\nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \\nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \\nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \\nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \\n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \\nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \\nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \\nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson\\'s disease, and Alzheimer\\'s disease.

These findings, according to \\ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \\nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \\ncountries. \\n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \\nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \\nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \\nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \\ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \\nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \\nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \\n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \\nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \\nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \\nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \\nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \\ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \\nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \\nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \\nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \\n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \\nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \\nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \\ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \\nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \\napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \\npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \\nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \\nlow in cholesterol and fat.\\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \\nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \\ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \\nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \\nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\\ncholesterol. \\n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \\nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \\nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \\nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \\ninvestigators\\' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \\nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \\nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \\ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \\nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \\nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \\nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \\n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \\npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \\nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \\nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \\nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \\nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \\nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \\nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet\\'s potential to elevate the cholesterol \\nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \\naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\\'s \"affluent\" diet used in the study \\nranks a CSI of 149. \\n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \\nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \\nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \\ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \\nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \\nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \\nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \\ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \\ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \\nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \\na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \\n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects\\' mean plasma \\ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \\nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \\nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \\nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \\nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \\nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \\ndays. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \\nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \\nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \\nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \\ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \\nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \\ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \\nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \\ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \\nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \\ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \\nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \\nof their usual high fat intake. \\n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \\npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \\naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \\nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \\nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \\nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \\nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \\nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \\nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \\n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \\nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \\nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \\ndisease starts with a given society\\'s elite, who typically eat a different \\ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \\nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \\nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \\ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \\nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \\nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \\nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \\ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \\nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \\nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \\nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                             General Announcments\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\\n\\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \\ncalling the NCI\\'s Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

Andrew Byler)\\n\\n1] An english translation of this can be found in:\\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an\\n   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance\", J. M. Wilson\\n   (London, 1923).\\n\\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\\n   reprinted 1970).\\n\\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don\\'t know if it\\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\\n\\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\\n\\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\\nearly \\'80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone\\'s interested.)\\n\\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\\nyou\\'re interested in examining the differences in the long recension\\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\\n   Society, 1971).\\n\\nMetzger\\'s book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\\n\\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\\n\\n\\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\\n\\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark\\'s edition\\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\\n\\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\\n\\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.',\n",

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among \\n21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This \\nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC\\'s National Hospital \\nDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. \\n     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been \\ncollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC\\'s National Center \\nfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were \\nabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 \\nparticipating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \\ncesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national \\nestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged \\nafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \\ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from \\nnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of \\ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \\nsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at \\nthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value \\nof 1.96. \\n     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as \\nin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean \\nrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \\nprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. \\nIn 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) \\nhigher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast \\n(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \\nthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \\ngovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \\nhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other \\nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \\npayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. \\n     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women \\nincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \\nthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, \\nessentially the same as the 23.5 observed. \\n     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nestimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated \\n338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary \\ncesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been \\nperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean \\ndelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, \\n35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., \\nfailure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal \\ndistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. \\n     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In \\ncomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, \\nand for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC \\ndeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 \\ndays). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for \\nprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and \\nnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. \\n\\nReported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center \\nfor Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from \\n1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates \\nhave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that \\nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \\ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \\nchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the \\noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \\ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). \\n     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections \\n-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \\nthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for \\ncesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in \\n1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and \\n$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \\n$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean \\nrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number \\nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), \\nresulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital \\ncharges. \\n     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may \\nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \\ndelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women \\noffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). \\nOf women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) \\n--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely \\noffered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nnational data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) \\nwas 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all \\nwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was \\nattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the \\nVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \\nrate. \\n     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \\napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \\ndelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review \\nprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \\ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \\nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of \\nphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \\nawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, \\nwhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean \\ndelivery (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of \\nState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases \\namong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the \\nhealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 \\ncases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June \\n1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and \\nCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and \\nidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This \\nreport summarizes the results of the investigation. \\n     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were \\navailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if \\nthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-\\nconfirmed as having malaria. \\n     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to \\nobtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria \\nchemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets \\nand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long \\nsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, \\n128 (82%) responded. \\n     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in \\nKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less \\nthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 \\nyears (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk \\nRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the \\ncases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, \\ncompared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the \\nKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for \\nmalaria. \\n     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who \\nparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine \\nalone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were \\nnot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly \\nlower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 \\n9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 \\n24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported \\nside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. \\n     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nall or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely \\nused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was \\nalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening \\n(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; \\nupper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with \\nfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the \\nevening. \\n     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel \\nthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \\nregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection \\nmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to \\nprovide window and door screens for all personnel. \\n\\nReported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical \\nSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, \\nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was \\nattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \\nregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased \\nmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan \\nAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and \\ncontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in \\nmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for \\nshort-term travelers to such areas. \\n     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most \\nother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas \\n(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In \\nAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in \\npreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and \\nwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk \\nfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis \\n(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 \\nusers 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, \\ngastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for \\nother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). \\n     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need \\nfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen \\n(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense \\nchloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for \\npersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil \\nis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be \\nused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. \\nfalciparum has not been reported. \\n     Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\non the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are \\navailable from Health Information for International Travel, 1992 (i.e., \\n\"yellow book\") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and \\npertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the \\nUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than \\n90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these \\norganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely \\nrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined \\nvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate \\ninjections. \\n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products \\nfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b \\nconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for \\nvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus \\ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine \\n(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in \\nvaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. \\n\\n                               ActHIB Trademark \\n\\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate \\nvaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), \\nmanufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB \\nTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This \\nvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary \\nvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously \\nunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months \\napart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one \\ndose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all \\nchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive \\na single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving \\na primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, \\nand 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b \\npolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to \\nthat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed \\nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in \\nprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early \\nbecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nfor use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease \\nwere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and \\nother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to \\nthat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark \\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus \\ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate \\nvaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl \\nRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL \\nRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and \\nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis \\nBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). \\n     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years \\nfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when \\nindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate \\nvaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody \\nresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark \\nis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, \\nand pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other \\nDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. \\n     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that \\nall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b \\nconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-\\n15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose \\nprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, \\n4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A \\ncomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and \\nTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed. \\n\\nReported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics \\nEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

An international steering committee and scientific \\nprogram committee provided guidance. \\n     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including \\nAsia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United \\nStates and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National \\nInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National \\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, \\nand the Procter and Gamble Company. \\n     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, \\nprofessional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision \\nof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and \\nmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and \\nwomen\\'s issues. \\n\\n                                Recommendations\\n\\n     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association \\nbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to \\nestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for \\nmore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology \\nstudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral \\nlesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. \\n\\n                                 Epidemiology\\n\\n     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV \\nInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nradically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely \\nin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  \\nToday, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in \\nchildren and adolescents. \\n     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a \\nmajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  \\nFive hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more \\nare appearing all the time. \\n     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions \\nsuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore \\nthe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression \\nand prognosis. \\n\\n                            Social/political Issues\\n\\n     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection \\nfocused on changing the public\\'s attitude that AIDS is retribution for \\nindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health \\ncare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public \\nabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. \\n\\n                          Saliva and Salivary Glands\\n\\n     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory \\nactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary \\nsecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular \\nsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid \\nsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible \\nfor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect \\nof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both \\npromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) \\ndirect effects on the virus or target cells. \\n     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease \\nin HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. \\n\\n                               Pediatric Issues\\n\\n     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With \\nearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-\\ninfected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from \\nmother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother\\'s \\nsero-status is known prior to giving birth. \\n\\n                    Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 12\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and \\ngingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection.  Recommendations made at \\nthe workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of \\ndiagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration \\nof confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. \\n\\n                       Occupational and Treatment Issues\\n\\n     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals \\nand treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command \\nconsiderable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit \\nof HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection \\nand the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the \\ntreatment of HIV-infected patients. \\n     Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on \\nthe Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.  \\nProceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence \\nCompany in late 1993.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--------- end of part 1 ------------\\n',\n",

I\\nwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because\\nI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I\\nwent to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.\\n\\n\\tAnyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to\\nget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;\\nbut he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.

The\\nantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought\\nsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't\\nnotice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about\\n1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.

       " u\"\\n\\n \\nCertainly. Reference follows. \\n\\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\\n\\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\\n\\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\\n\\n\\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\\ncouple of weeks ago.\\n\\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\\nhelp here.)\\n\\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\\nhave the monitor data.\\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\\nwhite) until it is displayable.\\n\\n\\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\\n\\n--\\nChris Lilley\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \\nManchester, UK.

I think the\\ndelaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are\\ninteresting because they\\'re attempts to gain advantage through control\\nof the flow and timing of the game.

       " u'OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,\\nthe effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\\'d do some more tests.\\n\\nFirst of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\\nrealistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...',\n",

Unbelievers are both those who openly reject\\nthe gospel, and those who do not know God.  The eternal destruction is the same\\nas the eternal hope in 2:16.  This distructions primarily emphasize that it is\\nseparation from the presence of God.  THe context is speaking of the 2nd advent\\nwhile 2:1 is speaking of the rapture.  Don\\'t confuse the two. \\n\\nYet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven.\\n\\n For instance,\\n\\nIf this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to\\nignite.\\nHowever, there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning\\nbush that was not consumed.  Also, the Daniel acct. shows that the laws of\\nnature can be interupted even with earthly fire.\\n\\n\\nMaybe you don\\'t understand.  There will be those who are alive at the end of\\nthe millenium, who will walk straight into the GWTJ.  Even those who have died\\nin their sin will be resurrected, i.e. reunited with their physical body, to\\nreceive condemnation.\\n\\n\\nThis is contrary to the teaching of Scripture.\\n\\n\\nTHis is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the \"no physical\\nbody\" thesis.\\n\\n\\nThe true awlfulness of hell, is that it is eternal separation from God, after\\nhaving seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ.  But whether it was open\\nrebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known\\nGOd (not saught Him as He is), then as Paul says, they are without excuss and\\nthat every mouth will be stopped.  There will be no defense at the judgment\\nseat of God. THerefore we understand \"it is appointed unto man once to die, and\\nthen comes judgment\" literally.  \\n\\njust because it is horrific, doesn\\'t make it less of a reality.  \\nit should compel those of us who have the riches of Christ to share it with\\nothers',\n",

       " u': Recently an e-mail to me mentioned:\\n\\n: (Technically, the messengers aren\\'t even human so\\n: it *can\\'t* be a case of \"homosexuality\" -- even of rape.) [...]\\n\\n: The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of\\n: the Sodomites\\' \"lust\" for the \"other flesh\" of angels.  Again,\\n: application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of\\n: gay Christians is largeely specious.\\n: ***\\n: Are angels \"flesh\"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because\\n: of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).\\n\\n: what are other opinons on this? I haven\\'t heard much about this verse  \\n: at all.\\n\\nBo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James, Peter, and Jude_ points\\nout that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing\\nthe elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general.  Hence, those\\nwho were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension,\\nGod); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Quoting Reike:\\n\\n\\t\"Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament,\\n\\trefer to idolatry, while \"flesh\" (as in I Pet 1:24) \\n\\tdenotes human society and its violent attempts at self-\\n\\texaltation.  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders\\n\\tof apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to\\n\\ttheir followers.\" [p. 199]\\n\\n\\nThere is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring\\nto actual sexual lust for \"alien flesh\".  Nor is it inherently necessary\\nto understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular\\nreasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin\\nof homosexuality.  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, and\\nnot merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 \"This was the guilt of your sister\\nSodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease,\\nbit did not aid the poor and needy.  They were haughty, and did abominable\\nthings before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.\\n\\nFor the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent\\'s\\nsuggestion that the reason the passage doesn\\'t deal with homosexuality\\nis because the guests were angels and not men is just silly.  There \\nare much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the\\nSodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se.',\n",

Noring and the\\nfellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set\\nof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---\\nnamely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,\\nmany of them appear to get better.  \\n\\nSo, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,\\ncontrolled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don\\'t do any\\nbetter than sugar water --- then let\\'s hear it.  If you don\\'t, then what we\\nhave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject\\ndisbelief on the other.

       " u'This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I\\'m posting my answer \\nhere.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human \\nnutrition.

So many women(and \\ntheir husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that \\nmost physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by \\ndiet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.

During the luteal phase of a women\\'s cycle, there is \\nincreased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose \\nchallenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are \\na low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia \\nis not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of \\nhypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.\\n\\tA. Am. J.

The intent of the \\n\\tstudy was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool \\n\\tsize(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this \\n\\tnormal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose \\n\\tvitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% \\n\\tgetting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.\\n  \\t10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS \\n\\tsymptoms.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Controlled Study, \"Premenstrual tension treated with \\n\\tvitamin A\" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts \\n\\treceived 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their \\n\\tcycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.\\n  \\tAfter 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in \\n\\tPMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of \\n\\ttoxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year \\n\\tafter high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms \\n\\tdid not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the \\n\\tvitamin A supplementation was stopped.\\n\\nMost Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  \\nThese studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal \\nstore of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins \\ngiven for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best \\nsingle effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid \\n(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full \\nof vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent \\nthe symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don\\'t want to be trying \\nto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin \\nA toxicity.\\n\\n\\tVITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, \"Pyridoxine\\n\\t(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover \\n\\ttrial\"J.R.

B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of \\n\\tPMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS \\n\\twere not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The efects of vitamin B6 \\n\\tsupplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms\" Obstet.

Analysis of convergence \\n\\tshowed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related \\n\\tto the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as \\n\\tbehavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)\\n  \\tAnxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 \\n\\tsupplementation.\\n\\nVitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control \\npills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  \\nWomen on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per \\nday.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. \\nRubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in \\nClin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be \\nconsidered the \"first-line\" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the \\npatient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin \\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each \\nday. \\n\\n\\n\\tVITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Efficacy of alpha-\\n\\ttocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome\" J.

After 2 cycles, both groups received \\n\\tmagnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster \\n\\tpain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the \\n\\tmagnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were \\n\\tswitched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on \\n\\tthe Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by \\n\\tmagnesium supplementation.

       " u'Conviction of Sin\\n\\n\\t\\tA meta-exegetical or methodological essay\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI look forward to reading it.  When I got to the library last week, it\\nwas with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared\\nover the last few years, since my previous look at the literature.  Un-\\nfortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didn\\'t get a\\nlook at the articles I was hoping to find.  I will continue to reserve\\nmy own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly\\nwork, and I can hope that REXLEX\\'s posting may give some meat to chew on.\\n\\nHowever, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues\\n-- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter.\\nIf the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better;\\nif not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard.\\n\\n\\nwrites, _in abstractu_:\\n\\n\\n\\t[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has\\n\\talready contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that\\n\\tthe ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and\\n\\tNOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on the\\n\\tarticle as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]\\n\\nThe hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and\\nb) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The\\nquestions I wish to raise are\\n\\n\\t1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?\\nand\\t2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the\\n\\t     discussion) that it is correct?\\n\\nNote that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),\\nwhich seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the\\nliterature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,\\nPaul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless\\nyou have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound\\nmethodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-\\nate text to \"fix\" the coinage\\'s meaning for his audience.\\n\\nAs yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm\\nor reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat\\nplausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way\\nof construing this problem passage.)  I\\'m going to set aside for the moment\\nthe question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the\\nmore tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,\\ntwo kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,\\nwe can look at the text of Paul\\'s letter for clarification or look outside\\nthat to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to\\nderivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul\\'s meaning.\\n\\nThe single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no\\ninternal evidence for Paul\\'s meaning.  He uses the word totally without an\\nexplanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of\\nnegatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.\\n\\nWe are left, as the only \"internal\" clue, with the etymology or formation\\nof the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before\\nhim) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with\\nother men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex (\"lie\" in\\nLeviticus, \"bed\" in Greek).  One problem is that \"bedders\" (_-koitai_) is\\nnot, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one\\nserious test which de Young\\'s hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:\\n\\n\\to  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much\\n\\t   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies\\n\\t   \"men who have sex with X\"  [obviously, the \"best case\" is to\\n\\t   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]\\n\\nsuch texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.\\nIt is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-\\nstandable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition\\nof the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn\\'t *prove* the hypothesis\\ncorrect -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or\\nnot original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible\\nof comprehension by his readers.\\n\\nMy \"test\" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT\\nin his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his\\nreaders to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)\\nor to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that\\nthey can guess his meaning without too much floundering.\\n\\nExternal evidence, that is, texts other than Paul\\'s own and lexicographic\\nor social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into\\nthe picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,\\nwhich *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by\\na contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-\\nality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one\\nhas grounds for\\n\\n\\to  denying that Paul coined the word\\nand\\to  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning\\n\\nDo you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his\\nreaders to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and\\nits intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young\\'s guess)\\nunderstand him to be referring to the Levitical \"universal\" prohibition\\nof male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized\\nat least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --\\nhow else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled\\nback from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah\\nlaw to his gentile converts!)\\n\\nAmong the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined\\nthe word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or\\nIonic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be\\nassimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than\\nusually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What\\nis Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?\\n\\nAnd if he *didn\\'t* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in\\nhis list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for\\nhis readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no\\nother.)\\n\\nI cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by\\nthis word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,\\nhad a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and\\nexplained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of\\nevidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.\\n\\nSo -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.\\nAnd it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.\\nI can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about\\nthe word:\\n\\n\\ta)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe\\n\\t    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities\\n\\n\\tb)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual\\n\\t    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their\\n\\t    part with the Leviticus passage)\\n\\n\\tc)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an\\n\\t    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not\\n\\t    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application\\n\\t    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER\\n\\t    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me\\n\\t    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I\\'m advancing.]\\n\\nOf these, I\\'d say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but\\nI still have reservations about that, too.\\n\\nIf the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence\\nof depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul\\'s coining it.  If it does\\nappear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior\\nuse (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should\\nnormally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they\\ncan be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In\\neither of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul\\'s relation\\nto the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be\\nfrom the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul\\'s relations are hardly straight-\\nforward!\\n\\nThere is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid\\nus in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as\\ngood as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).\\nBut it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don\\'t know about you, but I\\nfor one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means\\nbe convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he\\nsays elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this\\nsame character (Romans 14:22-23)\\n\\n\\t\"Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and\\n\\tconsider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going\\n\\tagainst his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt\\n\\tis condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done\\n\\tin bad faith is a sin.\"\\n\\nFor my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul\\'s meaning in the use of\\n_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by\\nthe nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty\\nof constraining Paul\\'s own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and\\nall the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --\\nand sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you\\nto God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul\\'s\\nwords HAVE led some people), then Paul\\'s intense communicative effort to\\ncontrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.\\nI have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I\\nread him \"in the large\", if I can see him lay out his position in detail\\nand hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his\\nmeaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)\\n\\nIn my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first\\nof my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm\\nthat Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as\\nthe Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-\\nthesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and\\nfor later Christians.  Given my verbosity, this will be tomorrow night\\'s\\nmeditation :-)',\n",

       " u'continuing part #4 (I think); used by permission,\\n\\nTHE SOURCE AND NT MEANING\\nOF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS\\nFOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY\\n\\n                                      James B. DeYoung\\n\\nW. Petersen\\n\\n     More recently Wright\\'s understanding has itself been questioned from a\\ndifferent direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic\\nconfusion in using the English word \"homosexuals\" as the meaning of\\narsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for\\nrendering it by \"homosexuals\" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.\\n\\n     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a\\nsingle assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds\\n\"homosexuals\" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  \"A\\nmajor disjunction\" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the\\nthought and terminolgy in Paul\\'s time (187-88).\\n\\n      What is this \"disjunction\"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic\\nfacts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as\\npolyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. \\nVirtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. \\nChristianity simply added the categories of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" in\\ndescribing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of\\n\"homosexuals\" and \"heterosexuals,\" and assumed that, in the words of Dover\\nquoted approvingly by Petersen, \"everyone responds at different times to both\\nhomosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . .\" (188). [23]\\n\\n      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term \"homosexual\"\\nto desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term\\nequivalent to \"homosexual,\" used it as referring to orientation, impluse or\\naffectional preference and having \"nothing to do with sexual acts\" (189).\\n\\n     Petersen then proceeds to cite the \"Supplement to the Oxford English\\nDictionary,\"  which defines \"homosexual\" only as a propensity or desire with no\\nmention of acts.  Petersen\\'s point is that by using \"homosexuals\" for\\narsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history\\n\"where no equivalent concept existed\" (189).  Consequently the translation is\\ninaccurate because it \"includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes\\nfemale homosexuals\" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no \"cognitive structure,\\neither inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of\\nhumanity into \\'homosexuals\\' and \\'hetersosexuals\\' made sence\" (189).\\n\\n     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio\\n\"homosexual\" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one\\nmistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next\\nphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen\\'s position.\\n\\n                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING\\n                          ARSENOKOITAI BY \"HOMOSEXUALS\"\\n\\nHistorical Grounds\\n\\n     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai\\nby \"homosexuals\" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since\\nvirtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul\\'s\\nusage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing\\nreveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary\\nwith Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of\\nhomosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to\\npresent-day concepts.  \\n\\n     Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual\\ncondition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be\\npart of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term\\nis limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; \\nScroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient\\ntimes (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of\\nthese positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion\\nfirst with the former one being addressed below under \"Linguistic Grounds.\"\\n\\n     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the\\nhomosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if\\nit is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including\\nancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. \\nIndeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only\\nknew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of\\nsame-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex\\norientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in\\n\"Symposium\" (189d-192d) may be a \"sole possible exception\" to ancient\\ningnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even\\nhere \"acts appear to be the deciding factor.\"  However, this is a very\\nsignificant exception, hardly worthy of being called \"an exception,\" because of\\nthe following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.\\n\\n     THe \"Symposium\" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for\\nknowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex\\ncomprised of a maile-female (androgynon (\"man-woman\"). Hence \"original nature\"\\npalai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these\\nhuman beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the\\ngods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the\\nopposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:\\n\\n    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like\\n    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever\\n    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections\\n    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are \\n    woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,\\n    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.\\n    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:\\n    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.\\n    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as \\n    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by\\n    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be\\n    clasped in men\\'s embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,\\n    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless\\n    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness\\n    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome\\n    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity\\n    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come\\n    to man\\'s estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in\\n    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of\\n    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.\\n    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the \\n    willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when\\n    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- \\n    happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously \\n    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be \\n    induced to leave each other\\'s side for a single moment.  These are\\n    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not\\n    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]\\n\\nShould these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as\\nlong as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each \"would\\nunreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all\\nthe time:  (192e).\\n\\n     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is\\ncontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  \"Natural interest\" (ton\\nnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. \\nThe words, \"born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: \\n(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims \"to\\nbe born this,\" i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity (\"the two of them\\nare wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love,\" 192b) is\\npresent.  Aristophanes even speaks of \"mutual love ingrained in mankind\\nreassembling our early estate\" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai\\ntes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency (\"These are\\nthey who continue together throughout life,\" 102c) is also present.  Further\\nmention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, \"gay pride,\" pederasty,\\nhomophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is\\nrecognizable.\\n\\n    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from\\nactions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is\\ncrucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). \\nThey mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow\\nkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its \"desire\" and \"passion\"\\n(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or \"matters\" of love (187c), the\\ndesires of love (192c) and being \"males by nature\" (193c).  Noteworthy is the\\nspeech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is\\nrelated to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for \"what is not\\nprovided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack.\"  This is\\nthe object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between \"what\\nsort of being is love\" and the \"works\" of love (201e).  This ancient\\nphilosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of\\nbeing or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]\\n\\n     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and\\nhomosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error\\nwhen he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not\\ninclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the\\nlatter. [27]\\n\\n     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where\\nhomosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In\\nRom 1:21-28 such phrases as \"reasoning,\" \"heart,\" \"becoming foolish,\" \"desires\\nof the heart.\" and \"reprobate mind\" prove Paul\\'s concern for disposition and\\ninclination along with the \"doing\" or \"working\" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). \\nEven the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor\\n6:9-11) by words describing what people \"are\" or \"were,\" not what they \"do.\" \\nHabits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.\\n23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise\\nto the other (cf. Mt 5:27).\\n\\n     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently\\nwas accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,\\npeople of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a\\nfew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,\\nSeneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an\\nadult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to\\nsome length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women\\n(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he\\njustifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange\\nof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).\\n\\n     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the\\n\"new labels\" of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" for sexual behavior.  These did not\\nbegin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even\\nnon-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,\\nPlutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]\\n\\nLinguistic Grounds',\n",

       " u'Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won \\ntheir second straight 5-0.  Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and \\noften by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some\\nrecently rare power with their bats.\\n\\nBelcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the\\ngame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\\nstriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working\\nfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \\nbreaking balls.\\n\\nTomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\\ndouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and \\nBarry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys\\n(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\\nthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\\nand a Tomlin wild pitch.\\n\\nIn fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\\n2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\\npoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would \\nlater score on Reggie Sanders\\' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead \\nafter 4.\\n\\nThe fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second\\ndouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the \\nleft field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on\\nTom Prince\\'s two-base passed ball.  \\n\\nThe Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the\\nfifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second \\nbeing of the \"bunt\" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a \\nfoul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith \"K\\'d\" to end any Pittsburgh hope.\\n\\nPittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,\\nMoeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings\\nwork.\\n\\nBarry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played \\nbruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for \"precautionary\\nX-rays\".

       " u\": Hi there,\\n: \\n: I'm german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now.\\n: There are many problems occuring for me. One of them is the ERA statistic for\\n: pitchers. What does it say ??\\n\\nERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per\\nnine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned\\nrun, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA\\nis 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided\\nby the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.\\n\\n\\tERA = (ER/IP) * 9\\n\\nAn earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed\\nto a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented\\nthe third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.\\nEarned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base\\nwhen the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:\\n\\n\\tIf there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If\\n\\tan error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after\\n\\tthis error and NOT counted as earned runs.\\n\\n\\tIf a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game\\n\\tbefore the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who\\n\\twere left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,\\n\\tand the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are\\n\\tattributed to the pitcher who left the game.\\n\\nI hope this explains things for you.\",\n",

It refers\\nto the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a\\nplace where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)\\nto Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires\\nburned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem.\\n\"To be cast into Gehenna\" or \"to burn in Gehenna\" thus became a\\nmetaphor for \"to be rejected or discarded as worthless.\"\\n\\nLest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart\\nis my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT\\nDIVORCE, by C S Lewis.

Why can't\\nGod just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us\\nsinless, without the need for repentance and salvation and all that?\\n\\nI don't particularly object to the idea of the assumption, or the\\nperpetual virginity (both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which\\nI will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in\\nChrist), and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, but this\\nconcept of Mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the\\nrest of Christian doctrine as I understand it.\",\n",

       " u'\\nI agree, with the exception that I don\\'t preach ignoring our cultures.\\n\\n\\nIn Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one\\ncongregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in\\neach city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they\\nformed something of a stew, with different members having different\\nheritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together,\\nsometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups\\nin places such as the temple courts.\\n\\nNow in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a\\ncommon language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin\\nwas spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would\\nmake sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common\\nlanguage and not necessarily Latin.\\n\\nNaturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common\\nlanguage.  In the first century church, there were probably many people\\nin the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the\\nmessage for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don\\'t\\nsee people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called\\nPentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though --\\nbi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member -\\nsometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet\\ntogether on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don\\'t speak\\nEnglish from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their\\nnative tongue.  Neat idea, huh?\\n\\nNow, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays,\\nso sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish-\\nspeaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their\\nnative language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times\\nduring the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone\\nwho speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also\\nspeak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those\\nmeetings.\\n\\nAs for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch\\nwith their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep\\nfriendships among their church relationships with people of many various\\nnationalities.  \\n\\n\\nThe action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of\\nLatin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second\\nclipping of your article.\\n\\nHowever, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a\\nculture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.\\n\\n\\nYou have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud\\nof their cultural heritages when most denominations didn\\'t.  Yet you have\\nlargely isolated yourselves from having quality \"Christian\" friendships\\noutside your nationality (and your denomination).\\n\\nWe shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their\\nheritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church\\nunity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.\\n\\n\\nIt sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going\\nabout things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist\\nEpiscopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.\\n\\nI understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such\\ngroups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it\\'s\\nhard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one\\nbody of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to\\nmake it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity,\\nwould be taking the word \"African\" out of your denomination\\'s name.  Then\\nperhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the \"Methodist\\nEpiscopal\" part also, and simply be part of \"the Church\".\\n\\n\\nThere shall be one church, for the sake of unity, AND it shall be useful\\nin helping students new to America make the transition in culture,\\nlanguage, and thought.  We shouldn\\'t make a new denomination to try to\\nsolve problems.  The whole denominational mindset only causes more\\nproblems, sadly.  \\n\\n\\nThank you for the invitation.  That shows me that you indeed have the\\nheart to spread the gospel of Jesus as well as take part in your cultural\\nheritage.  Thank you also for responding to my post.  I know (all too well)\\nhow they can be very time-consuming.\\n\\nThe whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions,\\nbut I still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same\\ntime.  My own church, the Boston church, has the acapella singing that you\\nmentioned in your post, yet doesn\\'t limit expression of my Mexican\\nculture, even though I am in the MIT Campus ministry and not the Spanish\\n(speaking) Zone.  I have made a commitment to God that I will go to the\\nSunday services of my church, because I know that my brothers and sisters\\nhere are fully devoted in love for God as his disciples.\\n\\nI don\\'t believe in tongues, as you may have already picked up on, because\\nof my understanding of Biblical Christianity.  However, I am certainly\\nwilling to visit your congregation provided that it doesn\\'t interfere with\\nmy normal worship.  Since you also live in Cambridge, I also extend an\\ninvitation to you to visit our services as often as you like.  You can\\nmeet the MIT students at the Student Center (across from 77 Mass.

You pick a number from 1-10\\nand win if that number is drawn.

After three\\nyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last\\nthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.\\n\\nDo we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?\\nNo.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these\\n\"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But\\nsuppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\\n\\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics,\\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\\n\\n\\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t\\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\\n\\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t\\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\\nway.\\n\\n\\nThen we would have something useful.

The Pharisees,\\nhypocritcal, unmerciful, self-righteous, pointed out others sins and\\ndid not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins.  What\\nI take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins,\\nthose sins will not be forgiven.  And since those guilty of even one sin\\nare guilty of the whole law, those not repenting the judging of others\\nare guilty, as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others\\nof.\\n\\nThe poor in spirit, meek, humble, merciful, pure of heart, peacemakers, \\nthose who thirst for justice, those who suffer for His sake are blessed.',\n",

       " u'I have been studying the Bible now for about a year.  I love it,\\nbut I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or\\ntraditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups.\\nI have heard various people (outside this news group)\\ndescribe *idols* such as power, money, material \\npossessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I \\nsuppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...  \\n\\nI have been reading the postings in this news group (which I \\njust found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I\\'m\\nnot trying to question anyone\\'s belief or try to push my views\\non anyone else (I haven\\'t been at this long enough to have\\nany views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good,\\nI must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that\\nI could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that\\nevery time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in\\nChrist\\'s side because He took the punishment for my sins,\\nwhen He died on the cross).\\n\\nIn my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is, \\nbut that\\'s about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary \\ncould be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?\\n\\nIt sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself\\nI\\'m sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend\\nthe summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about\\nTongues (I\\'m reading \"Charismatic Chaos\").  I guess I\\'ll study\\nTongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can \\ngive me will be appreciated.\\n\\n    -------------------------------------------\\n\\n[I don\\'t think the issue is so much that people are more educated than\\nyou (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a\\ndifferent tradition than yours.\\n\\nThis is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics\\ngenerally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The\\nissue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants\\ngenerally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.\\nSince this isn\\'t in the Bible (except in passages that no one would\\nunderstand in this way if they didn\\'t already believe it), Protestants\\ndon\\'t accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the\\nChurch, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.\\n\\nI interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about\\nwhether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am\\nnot prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in\\nlearning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of\\ncourse a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally\\nconsider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and\\nvarious subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it\\'s a matter\\nof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major\\ndivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those\\nwho don\\'t.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,\\nbut in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I\\'d \\nidentify the major Protestant traditions as:\\n\\n  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they\\'re sort of halfway between\\n  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,\\n  Church of Christ\\n\\nBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to\\nbe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think\\ncurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to make\\nconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general \"evangelical\"\\nperspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still\\nquite marked.\\n\\nI think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book\\non church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really\\nneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history\\nwill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and\\ngive a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I\\'m away from my\\nlibrary at the moment, so I don\\'t have anything specific to recommend.',\n",

She said even common ear infections frequently seen in\\nchildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n\"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases\\nwould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases\\nremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness\\nand death in the United States,\" the CDC said.\\n\\nIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a \"myriad\" of newly\\nidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a\\ndeadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that\\ncauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\n\"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,\\nsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,\"\\nthe CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been\\nundermined by drug resistance.\\n\\n=====*=====\\n\\nSOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL\\nREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1\\nHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues\\n\\nThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause\\ndamage: legal liability.\\n\\nA federal judge\\'s decision holding a property owner liable for not\\ndoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much\\nattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like\\nillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in\\nrare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners\\non notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from\\nthe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if\\nsomeone becomes infected while on the property.\\n\\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came\\nafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the\\nLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the\\ndisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered\\nthe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than\\n$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical\\nexpenses and lost wages.\\n\\nSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or\\nsemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the\\ngroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.\\nKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a\\nlegal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential\\nliability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard\\nbarbecue might be potentially liable.\\n\\nLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren\\'t unheard-of. A summer\\nvacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home\\nshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky\\nMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered\\nan outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was\\nstung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent\\nquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence\\nthat a beehive was near the restaurant.\\n\\nBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the\\ncountry -- it\\'s most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic\\nstates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this\\nparticular insect bite a particularly litigious one.\\n\\nThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the\\ncourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will\\ncover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not\\ndiagnosing the disease.\\n\\nLawyers say worker\\'s-compensation claims related to Lyme disease\\nhave become common in some states in recent years. Payments in\\nworker\\'s-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and\\nlost earnings.\\n\\nThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more\\nlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of\\nnegligence. Unlike the worker\\'s compensation process, the law governing\\ninjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a\\nresult, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property\\nowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many\\nother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the\\ndisease.\\n\\nIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &\\nMaurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help\\nto establish \"the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect\\nagainst Lyme disease.\"\\n\\nLawyers caution that despite Judge Ward\\'s decision, winning a\\nlawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For\\none thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when\\nand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs\\nin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned\\nby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.\\nThe workers, who weren\\'t outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to\\nthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded\\nsome work sites.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that\\nthe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is\\nconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward\\'s finding\\nthat it didn\\'t do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says\\nthe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special\\npants to protect against bug bites.\\n\\nDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up\\nsome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a\\nvictim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.\\nEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association\\nreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.\\nAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical\\ndisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.\\n\\nBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies\\nalready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last\\nyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &\\nCo. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston\\nthat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-\\nsupply company\\'s headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company\\nwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might\\nget infected.\\n\\nRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in\\nIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her\\norganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole\\nKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners\\nAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their\\n100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing\\npesticide.\\n\\n=====*=====\\n\\nTITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.\\nAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,\\nDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson\\nUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\nREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30\\n\\nLyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is\\nassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients\\nwith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.\\nUrodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and\\ndetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not\\nnoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract\\nmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding\\ndysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may\\ndirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the\\nLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological\\nsymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was\\nprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological\\ndeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme\\ndisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential\\ndiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder\\nmanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic\\nevaluation is recommended.\\n\\n\\nIV. ***** QUESTIONS \\'N\\' ANSWERS *****\\n\\nNote: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to the\\neditor.\\n\\nSender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.edu>\\nSubject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles\\n\\n  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the\\ncompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became\\ninfected.\\n\\n  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to\\nback that claim up with documentation.

First, you are discussing only\\nexperimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The\\nmain criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make\\nprediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be\\nthe result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity\\noccuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of\\nthe lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the\\nobservations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science -\\nit is\\n*not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted\\nsense.\\n\\nSecondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just\\nthe\\nrequirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.\\nThe\\nobservation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observer\\nmay\\nlook at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also,\\nthere is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will\\ncorrespond\\nto the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is\\ntested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some\\nconclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.\\n\\nUnfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been\\nperipheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, the\\nfront legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles,\\nrather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).\\n\\nSo, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the\\nnecessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the\\noriginal\\nevent does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.\\n\\n[This is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra-\\nterrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determination\\nof the process of abiogenesis relatively easy].\\n\\n--\\nsarima@teradata.com                     (formerly tdatirv!sarima)\\n  or\\nStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com\",\n",

In any case, my point is that\\na fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice\\nand isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good \\nreasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal \\nhell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between \\nGod and the Disloyal Opposition.

She instructed\\nher to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this \\nmedal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would\\nreceive great graces. In less than a year there were three more\\napparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reports\\nwere received by those who wore it.

She was\\ncanonized on July 27, 1947. Her body lies in the chapel at the\\nmotherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with\\nOur Lady.\\n\\nThe apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothed\\nin white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor.\\nAbove the altar, a pyramid painted to represent God\\'s all knowing\\nwisdom looked down on them. Our Lady\\'s feet rested on a white globe\\nand there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was\\nstepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world.\\nGreat streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed \\nCatherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped in\\npiercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The sword\\nrepresented her suffering with Jesus.\\n\\nThe apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned\\nthat a dark era lay in the immediate future.

And those of us who are fighting for the right to life\\nof the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or\\ncrime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God\\nhas entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.\\n\\n\\nTHE IMPRECATORY PSALMS\\n\\nEarly in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for\\njudgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to\\nrespond to them. Prayers such as:\\n\"Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for\\nhis wickedness ...\" Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the\\ngospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly\\nmotivated by love for God (\"The Lord is King for ever and ever;\\nthe nation will perish from His land\" 10:16, and \"Why does the\\nwicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who\\nsuffer (\"You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You\\nencourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the\\nfatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,\\nmay terrify no more.\" 10:17-18)\\n\\nNevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such\\ngraphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: \"Pour out your\\nwrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them\" 64:24; \"O\\nLord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O\\nJudge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve.\"\\n95:1-2; \"Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them\\nvanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The\\nrighteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe\\ntheir feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, \"Surely\\nthe righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who\\njudges the earth.\\'\" 58:6-11\\n\\nCertainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply\\ndestressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray\\nfor God to \"pour out His wrath\" on the wicked?\\n\\nThe scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be\\nprayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.\\nRather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against\\nHis enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these\\nimprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and\\nwhose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who \"boast of evil\"\\nand \"are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots\\ndestruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise\\ndeceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than\\nspeaking the truth.\" 52:1-3; \"They crush your people ... They\\nslay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.\" 94:5-\\n6; \"With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot\\nagainst those You cherish.\" 83:3; \"You hate all who do wrong. You\\ndestroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the\\nLord abhors.\" 5:5-6.\\n\\nTo those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:\\n\"Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin\" 52:5;\\n\"Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who\\ngo on in their sins\" 68:21.\\n\\nAnd the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: \"Then\\nit will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...\"\\n59:13; \"to proclaim the powers of God\" 68:34; \"All kings will bow\\ndown to Him and all nations will serve Him \" 72:11; \"Who knows\\nthe power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear\\nthat is due You. \" 90:11\\n\\nYet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include\\nimprecations (prayers invoking God\\'s righteous judgement upon the\\nwicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.\\nHowever, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much\\nmore common.\\n\\n\\nPRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS\\n\\nAmidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I\\nfound the survivors of communist persecution including the\\ncrippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to\\nstrike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.\\nI was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven\\npray \"How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge\\nthe inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?\" Revelation\\n6:10).\\n\\nThe initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino\\nNeto. Described as a \"drunken, psychotic, marxist poet\", Neto had\\nbeen installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.\\nHe boasted that: \"Within 20 years there won\\'t be a Bible or a\\nchurch left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity.\" Yet\\ndespite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is\\nnot Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.\\nNeto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in\\nMoscow.\\n\\nIn Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded\\nof God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:\\n  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be\\n     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.\\n  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles\\n     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be\\n     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in\\n     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was\\n     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal\\n     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.\\n  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a\\n     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car\\n     crash the very next day.\\n  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on\\n     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to\\n     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted\\n     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,\\n     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to\\n     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded\\n     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would\\n     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against\\n     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building\\n     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.\\n     \"They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord\\n     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the\\n     Lord spread widely and grew in power. \" Acts 19:17,20\\n\\nNicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the\\npersecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and\\nexecuted on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of \"the\\nantiChrist is dead\" in the streets. Many testified that this was\\nin answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of\\nRomania.\\n\\nAnother persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora\\nMachel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel\\nwas a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in\\nthe 1960\\'s. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would\\ndestroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly\\nMarxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in\\nMozambique were closed confiscated, \"nationalised\" chained and\\npadlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,\\nsome being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles\\nwere ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,\\nincluding many pastors and elders, were shipped off to\\nconcentration camps - most were never seen again.\\n\\nA month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly\\nand challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him\\n(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were\\nspecifically praying for God to stop the persecution in\\nMozambique, Machel\\'s Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent\\nthunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa\\'s\\nboundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans\\nfor overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and\\npublished. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,\\nbut He had also saved a country from persecution.\\n\\nIn the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in\\nZambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27\\nyear socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on\\n31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to\\nChrist whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected\\npresident of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian\\ncountry.\\n\\nIt is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,\\ndeclared trembling and in tears: \"I am more afraid of John Knox\\'s\\nprayers than of an army of ten thousand\".\\n\\nOn 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African\\nCommunist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented\\ninternational wave of condolences and adulation reported one\\ncould be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a\\nmartyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ\\nJesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa\\nthis Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.\\n\\nThe stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people\\nwere murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective\\nconcern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of\\nthe SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other\\nvictims. Indeed the SA government, the international community\\nand the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported\\nover this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans\\nmurdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were\\nunbanned!\\n\\nYet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,\\nDeputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC\\'s \"military\\nwing\" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani\\nhad approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many\\nunarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: \"all who live by the sword\\nwill die by the sword \" Matt 26:52.\\n\\nAfter personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities\\nat a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly\\ndeclared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser\\nArafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs\\nand limpet mines in public places during \"the struggle\") I told\\nhim that I was a Christian and, while I didn\\'t hate him, I did\\nhate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either\\nbring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God\\nwould remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he\\nwas an atheist.\\n\\nSeveral other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani\\nto repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in\\nAmerica have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against\\nunrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck\\ndown, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,\\nwithin months of these public prayers for God to stop these\\nkillers of preborn babies.\\n\\nSome praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:\\n\"When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror\\nto evildoers \" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any\\nChristian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -\\neven of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory\\nprayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did\\nour Lord (Matt 11:20-24).\\n\\nWhat then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?\\nShould we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I\\nwould like to present a short summary of an excellent book, \"War\\nPsalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory\\nPsalms\" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and\\nReformed Publishing Company):\\n\\nOur Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly\\nin teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the\\nOld Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT\\nare from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50\\ntimes. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.\\n\\n\\n1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?\\n\\nSome Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as\\n\"devilish\", \"diabolical \", \"unsuited to the church\", and \"Not God\\n\\'s pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of\\na man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus\\'\\nteaching that we should love our enemies. \"\\n\\nYet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:\\n\"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,\\nrebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the\\nman of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. \"\\n(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).\\n\\nThe fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our\\ncomprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its\\ninspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil\\nis to impudently take the place of God.\\n\\nDo we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God\\nhave led many to become \"evangelic plastic surgeons who have made\\nit their job to \"clean up\" God\\'s Word according to their own\\nideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone\\nwho must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for\\nHis Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the\\nauthority of God\\'s Word (like Eve\\'s original sin of listening to\\nSatan\\'s question \"Yes, hath God said... ?\").\\n\\nThe Psalms are part of God\\'s revelation of Himself and His\\nattributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the\\nauthoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these\\nevangelical plastic surgeons reject as \"unsuited\" and \"unworthy\"\\nfor the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about\\nHimself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles\\nused as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb\\n4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.\\n\\nCH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially\\nPs 109):\\n\"Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage\\nwhich the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in\\njudgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would\\nspeak to us therein. \"\\n\\nThe rejection of any part of God\\'s Word is a rejection of the\\ngiver of that Word, God Himself.\\n\\n\\n2. Who is praying these Psalms?\\n\\nChrist quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually\\nspoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an\\nenormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer\\nbook and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at\\nthe Last Supper.\\n\\nOn the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient\\nauthority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own\\nwords - the words of the Lord\\'s Anointed - which as David\\'s Son\\nHe truly was.\\n\"Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit\" Ps 31:5\\n\"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" Ps 22:1\\n\\nIn His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on\\nthe day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!\\nMatt 7:23 \"Then I will tell them plainly, \\'I never knew you. Away\\nfrom me, you evildoers\\'. \" Ps 6:8\\n\\nIn Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ\\nalthough nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said\\nthese words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22\\ndirectly to Christ despite there being no record of His having\\nspoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed\\nChrist is speaking in the Psalms.\\n\\nChrist came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in\\nall the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again\\nto execute Judgement on the wicked.\\nDavid as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a\\nprototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:\\n\"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the\\nresurrection of Christ. \"\\nDavid was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in\\nhis words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah\\nspoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by\\nChrist. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His\\nforerunner David.\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of\\nGod, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion\\nfor the wronged.\\n\\n\\n3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?\\n\\nChrist is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for\\nour sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with\\nthe sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for\\nwhich He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the\\nsubstitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah\\n53).\\n\\n\"God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we\\nmight become the righteousness of God. \" 2 Cor 5:21\\n\\nIn history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have\\nbeen understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St\\nAugustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.\\nAll the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the\\nimprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord\\nJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is\\nonly right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy\\nHis enemies.\\n\\nThese prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of\\nKing Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God\\'s Word is revealed\\nupon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God\\'s way of\\nforgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses\\nof God.\\n\\nHe who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a\\nreality when He declares to those on His left:\\n\"Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared\\nfor the devil and his angels. \" Matt 25:41\\n\\nAll the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God\\'s\\nKingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone\\nwill reign forever!\\n\"With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a\\nsharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule\\nthem with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of\\nthe wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. \"\\nRev 19 : 15\\n\\n\\n4. Are Jesus\\' prayers contradictory?\\n\\nWhat about Jesus\\' command to love our enemies and to bless those\\nwho curse us (Matt 5:44)?\\n\\nChrist is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives\\nsin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement\\non those who disobey His Gospel.\\n\\n\"God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you\\nand give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when\\nthe Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His\\npowerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel\\nof our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting\\ndestruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from\\nthe majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in\\nHis holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have\\nbelieved. \" 2 Thess 1:6-10\\n\\nJesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on\\nearth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see\\nboth the vengeance and the love ot God.\\n\\nEven in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations.\\n\"Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of\\ngreed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You\\nbrood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? \"\\nMatt 23\\n\\nIn Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His\\nbetrayal by Judas.\\n\\nWe also need to acknowledge that Christ\\'s prayers of blessing are\\nnot for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only\\npraying to the elect of God - those who have:\\n\"obeyed your Word\"... \"accepted\" God\\'s Word ... and have\\n\"believed \". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the\\nmessage of God\\'s kingdom will be judged.)\\n\\n\\n5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?\\n\\nMartin Luther pointed out that when one prays: \"Hallowed be Thy\\nName, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done \" then \"he must put all\\nthe opposition to this in one pile and say: \\'Curses, maledictions\\nand disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May\\nthey be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and\\nwisdom and plans run aground\\' . \"\\n\\nTo pray tor the extension of God\\'s kingdom is to solicit the\\ndestruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: \"The God of\\nheaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it\\nwill crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it\\nwill itself endure forever. \"\\n\\n* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for\\nthe kingdom of darkness. *\\n\\nThere is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church\\ncannot exclude hatred tor satan\\'s kingdom from its love for God\\'s\\nkingdom. God\\'s kingdom cannot come without satan\\'s kingdom being\\ndestroyed. God\\'s will cannot be done on earth without the\\ndestruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of\\nevil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism\\nwhich insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights\\nof man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.\\n\\nNote Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who \"plot\\ntogether\" against God and His people:\\n\"Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O\\nLord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and\\nJabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like\\nrefuse on the ground. \"\\n\\nThe story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)\\nprovides a vivid example of God\\'s judgement on the wicked. Sisera\\n\"cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years\" and they\\n\"cried to the Lord for help\" Judges 4:3. In response to those\\nprayers: \"The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by\\nthe sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...\\nAll the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. \"\\nJudges 4:15-16\\n\\nThe account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the\\ntent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety\\nand then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The\\nsong of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of\\nthe head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is\\nthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. \"As\\nyou did to Sisera ...\"\\n\\n\\n6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:\\n     \"If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,\\n     which are written in this book, and do not revere this\\n     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord\\n     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He\\n     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you\\n     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also\\n     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not\\n     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are\\n     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...\\n     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be\\n     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. \"\\n     Deuteronomy 28:58-63\\n\\nThe covenant God made with His people included curses for\\ndisobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27\\nrecords the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in\\nan awesome account:\\n\"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud\\nvoice:\\n\"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing\\ndetestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman\\'s hands - and\\nsets it up in secret. \"\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \"\\n\"Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...\\n\"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour\\'s boundary stone...\\n\"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...\\n\"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the\\nfatherless or the widow...\\n\"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...\\n\"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent\\nperson.\\n\"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by\\ncarrying them out.\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \" Deut 27:14-26\\n\\nThe New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of\\nrejecting Christ is the curse. \"If anyone does not love the\\nLord - a curse be on him. \" 1 Corinthians 16:22\\n\\n(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-\\n31; 12:14-29.)\\n\\n\\n7. How can we preach these prayers?\\n\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.\\nScripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-\\nin-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on\\nthose orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we\\nexpect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the\\ntroops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the\\nstrongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not\\nhear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him\\nonto the battlefield?\\n\\nPastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church\\'s\\nCommander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job\\nis to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain\\nand severe punishment if he dared to amend the general\\'s orders.\\nThe pastor\\'s charge is of greater importance than that of a\\ncourier in any earthly army. There\\'s no place tor the dispatcher\\nto decide he doesn\\'t agree with his Commander\\'s strategy.\\n\\nWhen Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching\\nmission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God\\'s Kingdom (Lk\\n10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God\\'s\\nrule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on\\nany house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected\\nit, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we\\nmust consider what He said they should do if their message were\\nrejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against\\nGod\\'s rule - \"But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go\\ninto its \\'streets and say, \\'Even the dust of your town that\\nsticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:\\nThe kingdom of God is near\"\\' Luke 10:11.\\n\\nWhat would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it\\nwill be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent\\nfire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that\\ntown (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,\\nBethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message\\n(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great\\nauthority He had given them: \"He who listens to you listens to\\nMe; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects\\nhim who sent Me \" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor\\ncalling down God\\'s curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion\\nagainst God\\'s authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of\\nHis servants.\\n\\nWe need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the\\nPrince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its\\nlethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on\\nthe battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks\\nwill be inevitable.\\n\\nLike Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of\\nobedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is\\nthat God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he\\nreap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in\\nDeut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings\\n6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant\\nbreakers is real.\\n\\nThe \"I\" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The \"we\" of the Psalms\\nincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our\\nown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The\\nPsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record\\nChrist\\'s march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As\\nChrist is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final\\nfulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will\\nanswer the psalmist\\'s prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the\\nfinal day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when\\nHe will say: \"But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be\\nKing over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me\"\\nLuke 19:27.\\n\\nA fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to\\nobey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war\\npsalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God\\'s\\nkingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by\\nthe kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local\\ncongregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your\\nbattalion to put on the whole armour of God, including \"the sword\\nof the Spirit, which is the Word of God \" Eph 6:17. That battle-\\nreadiness also involves \"pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions\\nwith all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.\\n\\nChrist teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the\\nenemies of God as the psalmist did: \"Pour out Your wrath on the\\nnations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not\\ncall on Your Name\" Ps 79:6.\\n\\nTo deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it\\nis necessary for us to pray for God\\'s justice. Those who are\\npersecuted need the comfort of these prayers.\\n\\n\"Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the\\npraise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in\\ntheir hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment\\non the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles\\nwith shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against\\nthem. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. \" Ps\\n149:5-9\\n\\nPrayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for\\nconversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement\\non those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army\\nof God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He\\nhas given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people\\nnf God to destroy evil.\\n\\nIf you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or\\nundermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword\\nanew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of\\nJesus - until \"the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as\\nthe waters cover the sea\" Hab 2:14.\\n\\nThe full book \"War Psalms of the Prince of Peace \" is available,\\nat R25, from Frontline Fellowship, PO Box 74 Newlands, 7725 RSA.\\n',\n",

Not that I hold him as an\\nauthority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light\\nof these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar-\\nnation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later\\ntimes, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first\\ntwo millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes \\nimportant that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our \\nunderstanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the \\nsignificance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I \\nhave tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible \\nto scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.\",\n",

       " u'Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kevin\\nBass would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kevin\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 49.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.

       " u'Easy vs. Hard .....Easy on who?\\n\\nI had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year.  She said\\nthat when she and my father were raising we four children, they\\ndid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised\\nin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be\\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\\nHim...sins that the \"world\" told me were OK.\\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\\nchange...but I shouldn\\'t have married to person in the first place )\\nand more....\\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\\ncounsel.\\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\\n  This life is \"but dust\". As long as the comfort of this life\\nis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those\\nwith whom we come in contact.\\n  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who\\nsupport the \"right\" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,\\nor who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in\\nthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving\\nfriend that these things are *wrong*.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\\nshould be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\\n-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\\n\\n\\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\\n\\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\\n\\n\\t\"\\'I am free to do anything,\\' you say.  Yes, but not everything\\n\\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\\n\\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\\n\\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it\\'s a secondary\\nargument from the \\'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God\\'s messengers.\\n\\nI won\\'t deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\\n\\nI\\'m dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\\nof the ritual law?\\n\\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\\n\\n\\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\\nyou can think of to do so.\\n\\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\\n\\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\\n\\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\\nWHY, for God\\'s precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\\ncondemn people you don\\'t know and won\\'t even take the trouble to LISTEN\\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\\ncondemn others?

       " u'The last time we discussed homosexuality, I asked whether anyone could\\nidentify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible\\nprohibited, but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent\\nharm to anyone. Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\\nquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting\\nresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).\\n\\nHowever, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.\\nLink Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping\\nwith one\\'s aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can\\'t\\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\\ndead and that he has \"married\" her? How does this case differ\\nfrom the *duty* to marry one\\'s brother\\'s childless wife.\\n\\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\\nof understanding why.\\n\\nP.S. Please don\\'t bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,\\nas some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.\\nYou don\\'t know whether I am homophobic or not.

       " u'\\n\\n\\nThis is something I\\'ve always found a little curious. I\\'ve never quite understood\\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\\nat the same time, he is God\\'s son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\\nhe really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\\nthen it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s \\nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\\ncase, Jesus and God aren\\'t the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\\nisn\\'t the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\\nincarnate, then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was. He\\'s just God\\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I\\'m seeing it. Can someone\\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \\n\\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\\nThe fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much\\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\\n \\n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\\ngroup, it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense,\\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\\nBirth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility.  But it doesn\\'t\\nimply that God\\'s sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material.\\n\\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\\na part of God.  The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth.\\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn\\'t\\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it\\'s the Son\\nwho was incarnated.',\n",

Anyway, back\\nto current affairs,\\n\\n\\nAmong others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone\\nelse dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you\\nwill, known (according to Umar Khan) to \"Every Muslim school boy and\\ngirl\", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.\\n\\n\\nYes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing\\nabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing\\nthe actor \"Gibreel\" in the role of the angel whose name he took.\\nRushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims\\nor implies that this is what actually happened.  It\\'s somewhat like\\nstories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed\\nprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the\\nArthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens\\nof others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,\\nconsider Salman Rushdie\\'s children\\'s book \"Haroun and the Sea of\\nStories\" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific\\nstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.\\n\\n\\nNo.  Muhammad\\'s [Mahound\\'s] integrity is not really impugned in this\\npart of the story, and there\\'s no reason to think this was Rushdie\\'s\\nintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and\\nsatanic), though he doesn\\'t know their provenance.  It is not implied\\n(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:\\n\\n    \" *Not my voice* I\\'d never know such words I\\'m no classy speaker\\n    never was never will be but this isn\\'t my voice it\\'s a Voice.\\n      Mahound\\'s eyes open wide, he\\'s seeing some kind of vision,\\n    staring at it, oh, that\\'s right, Gibreel remembers, me.

Is it Satan?\\nOr something else?  The answer is not given.\\n\\nTo be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the\\nrole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss\\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very\\nexistence of a newsgroup named \"alt.atheism\" raises the same\\nquestions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is\\nthe real relevance.  If Rushdie\\'s mild fictional exploration is \"filth\\nand lies\", and he \"asked for what he got\", are we next on the fatwa\\nlist?

       " u'Note:  I\\'m not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard,\\nbut as an independent sort of thread.  I do actually quote some things\\nthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as\\n\"sampling\" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what\\nI want to say.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\\nteam and some people\\'s conception of a biological organism.  In the\\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \\nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\\n\\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ Z\" onto\\n\\'brain\\').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\'\\nabove might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross\\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\\n\\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\\n\\n\\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\\n\\n\\nIn this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\\n\\n\\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\\nit\\'s unclear what it all really means.\\n\\n***\\n\\nNow just one more un-related point:\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference\\nbetween the winners and the losers.\\n\\nMoreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\\n\\n\\nSince stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the\\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\\neven though I\\'m relying on stats to do it.',\n",

For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen\\n    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent\\n    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal\\n    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is\\n    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.\\n                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of \\n                   Thessalonica, A.D. 392\\n\\nNote that St. Augustine\\'s conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.

Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,\\nbut the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.\\n\\nThe celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was\\ngiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept\\nfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).\\n\\n\\nNo.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not\\nbased on private revelation.

This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as\\na dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be\\nbelieved by the faithful.\\n\\nThe apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.

       " u\"TWINS UPDATE --  Posted April 22, 1993  \\n---------------------------------------------\\nThe Twins defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 today to conclude a three game\\nhomestand with the Brew crew.  The Twins took two of three games in the series,\\nwith scores as follows:\\n\\n                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10\\n                                        Mil  0\\n                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  \\n\\n                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)\\n                                        MN   8\\n                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )\\n\\n                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5\\n                                        Mil 4\\n                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)\\n                    Sa - Aguilera\\n\\nHighlight/Low Lights of the Series:\\n------------------------------------\\nJim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of\\nthe American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0\\nwith a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning\\nhis ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with\\nPhiladelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail\\nlook like a true genius.\\n\\nWillie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings\\non Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now \\ncombine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are\\n0-5.\\n\\nWednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the\\nTwins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and \\nsubsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead\\nto 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing\\n4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.\\nTapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike\\nHartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and\\nthe Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win\\nit.\\n\\nAguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown\\nsaves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.\\nComing into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,\\nthen hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the\\nside.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.\\nWeak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.\\n\\nGeneral News\\n-------------------------------------\\nPedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on\\nTuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,\\nthough, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former\\nGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.\\n\\nThe Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting\\nPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit\\nTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide \\nquite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.\\n\\nThe Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,\\nthe third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.\\n\\nBrian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second\\nthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.\\n\\nJim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he \\nhas the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch\\nout of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 \\nstart.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly\\nin response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the\\nrubber on the pick-off move.\\n\\n\\nCurrent MLB AL West Standings( from Joesph Hernandez, jtchern@ocb.berkeley.edu  )\",\n",

You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,\\nhaving quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow\\nreverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made\\nto the 8 bit image palette.\\n\\nPerhaps that is why you yused the singular?\\n\\n\\nLook, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main\\ncontrol panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit\\nimage. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\\n\\n\\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\\n\\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\\nhuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it\\nwas designed for. It makes no false claims.\\n\\n\\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So \\nfar, you have not done so.\\n\\n\\nArgh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it\\nif it is so easy.\\n\\nOr alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.\\n\\n\\nI think this is a bit of an exageration.\\n\\nWhat you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in\\nthe states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up.

       " u'The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary\\non some of the public\\'s perception of doctors and their salaries.\\nI hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.\\n\\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n[Reprinted w/o permission]\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors\\' salaries\"\\n\\nBy Mike Royko\\nTribune Media Services\\n\\n\\n     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors\\' earnings \\nis right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \\nFamilies USA.\\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \\nthat doctors make too much money.\\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \\nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \\nOK.\\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \\nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \\nand are still simmering.\\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \\nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \\nof Americans don\\'t make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \\ndo are stealing it from them.\\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don\\'t  kid  yourself.  \\nKarl Marx lives.\\n     It\\'s also stupid because it didn\\'t ask key  questions,  such \\nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \\nbecome a physician?\\n     If those polled said no,  they didn\\'t know, then they should \\nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \\nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \\na doctor should earn if they don\\'t know what it takes to become a \\ndoctor?\\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  \"How \\nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \\ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \\nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \\ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \\nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \\nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \\nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \\n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \\nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \\ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \\ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \\nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \\nmore until they retire or fall over?\"\\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \\nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \\nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \\ncalled together to remake America\\'s health care.\\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \\nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \\nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \\nto health what Clinton\\'s first budget is to frugality.\\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \\nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \\nmajor cause of high medical costs.\\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \\nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \\nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \\na McDonald\\'s?\\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \\na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \\ncabbages.\\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \\nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \\ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \\n     \"Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \\nproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, \\nyou,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you \\nguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; \\ngetting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the \\nmicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into \\nthe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot \\nvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease \\nwhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.\\n     \"You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single \\nbiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is \\namazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.\\n     \"In fact,  I don\\'t understand how they can stand looking  at \\nyour blubbery bods all day.\\n     \"So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and \\nstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-\\ngreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.\"\\n     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, \\nthere is another solution: Don\\'t use them.\\n     That\\'s right.   You don\\'t feel well?   Then try one of those \\nspine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands \\nupon your head and declare you fit.\\n     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest \\npains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit \\nthere, and pop in a couple of valves.\\n     You\\'re  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that \\noverpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house \\nthan  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and \\nmalpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?\\n     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  \\nAnd if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on \\nhow to give it its shots.\\n     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much \\npollsters should earn?\\n\\n\\nRoyko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  Media \\nServices.\\n\\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n',\n",

Somehow I\\'ve managed to \\ndelete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send \\nit back to me but he\\'s pretty mad at me right now so I\\'ll just retype it.\\nSince digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all \\nday for that PMS post), I\\'m not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has \\nthem).  I\\'m going to include some of the material from Weinsier and \\nMorgan\\'s new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to \\npoint out that what I\\'m going to say has some support in the medical \\ncommunity.\\n\\nDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long \\ntime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I\\'ve \\nalready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.\\nNow I\\'m going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in \\nthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).\\n\\nWhen vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as \\nthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have \\ndecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C\\n(which I\\'ve already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is \\nalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).\\nThe NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if \\nvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It\\'s role in \\nboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).\\n\\nVitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and \\nbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it\\'s toxic, beta-carotene \\nis the plant form and it\\'s completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-\\ncarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present\\n(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other \\ntissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human \\nadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We \\nare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about \\n30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they \\nwere born with.  If you don\\'t believe that nutritional reserves(like that \\nof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is \\nnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient \\nreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.\\n\\nThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of \\nvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet \\nsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A\\n(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National \\nResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the \\nRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to \\n7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it\\'s recommendations was \\nkilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main \\nreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient \\nreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to \\nmove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move \\ntowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have \\nsome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely \\nimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that \\nbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the \\n1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the \\ndietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the \\n1940\\'s(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill \\nthe reserves).\\n\\nWe know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a \\nnormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient \\nreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.\\nBut for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how \\nmuch somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has \\noverfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol \\nlevel(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your \\nliver with vitamin A and it\\'s time to stop taking retinol).  The normal \\nrange of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is \\ndiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation \\nof Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level \\nof vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to \\nvitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative \\napproach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in \\nthis post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty \\nof warning that it\\'s time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, \\nredness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).\\n\\nI tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they \\nhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear \\nsigns that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient \\nneeds the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you \\nwill always know when it\\'s time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for \\nPMS studies).\\n\\nBeta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will \\nnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to \\nretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the \\nliver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But \\ntaking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to \\nfill the liver up(I\\'ve seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% \\nthat only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One \\nother problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not \\nconvert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the \\nenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of \\nretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will \\ncause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.\\n\\nNow what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body \\nuses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be \\nnailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde\\n(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the \\nretinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses \\nretinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells \\nand the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, \\none of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the \\ntitle of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play \\na role in infection(interferon production for example) but it\\'s biggest role \\nis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake \\nof vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But \\nretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once \\nit\\'s formed, it\\'s used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC \\ngroup wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA\\'s.\\n\\nMost people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are \\nhelping themselves.  If they don\\'t have much vitamin A in their liver and \\nthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do \\nthemselves more harm than good.\\n\\nRetinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.\\nIn the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus \\nproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from \\nentering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the \"first \\nline\" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown \\nto act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which \\nstimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration \\nand cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters \\nare not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not \\nnormally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.\\nThis is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials \\nin progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.\\n\\nChronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that \\nvitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who \\nwalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be \\nworked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already \\nhas on it\\'s list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my \\ncourse at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic \\nmedical school in Tulsa(OU\\'s branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.\\n\\nDark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night \\nvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The \\nserum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver \\nreserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have \\ntrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled \\nout).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels \\nwere measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below \\n20ug/dl.\\n\\nAs more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of \\nthe U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably \\nsee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low \\nserum retinol levels.\\n\\nWhat do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts\\nfrom their book:\\n\\nVitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for \\ngrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for \\nreproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie \\nmalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and \\nmetabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, \\nwhich has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not \\nin reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A \\nstatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal \\nrange for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are \\nindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater \\nthan 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation \\ntests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to \\nperform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to \\nvitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The \\nbronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal \\ntract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than \\n7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts \\nover 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, \\nerythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois\\n(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  \\n\\nThey recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A \\ndeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol \\nlevel is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in \\nadults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule \\nout a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical \\nlab can\\'t run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give \\nthem the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity \\nshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the \\npatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.\\n\\nBoth Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.\\nRecall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.\\nI don\\'t suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to \\nfill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the \\nserum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the \\nvitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a \\ndemonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will \\nprovide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status \\nare good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more \\nagressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But \\nvitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could \\nbecome pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human \\nfetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is \\n18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on \\nthe human fetus.\\n\\nCould just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes \\nbut the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use \\nretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it \\nfull.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to \\nprescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.\\'s in this newsgroup \\njumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A \\nsupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I \\nthink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market \\nbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general \\npublic about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.',\n",

In 1992\\nhe hit .264.  Not surprising, huh?  Also in 1992: \\n\\nNon-Clutch:\\t 536 AB\\t\\t144 H\\t\\t.269\\nClutch:\\t\\t  86 AB\\t\\t 20 H\\t\\t.233\\n\\nNo, this doesn\\'t prove any overall statistical trend that can\\nbe used to predict future performance across the breadth of \\nmajor league ballplayers.

       " u'\\nI can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues, \\nhowever, a couple of them seem as though they do not require \"incredibly \\nperverse interpretations\" in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.\\n\\n\"... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, \\nnor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, \\nnor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such were \\nsome of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\\n\\nWould someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say\\nfornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God?  How does this apply\\nto homosexuals?  I understand \"fornication\" to be sex outside of\\nmarriage.  Is this an accurate definition?  Is there any such thing as\\nsame-sex marriage in the Bible?  My understanding has always been that\\nthe New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband\\nand his wife.  I am, however, willing to listen to Scriptural evidence\\nto the contrary.\\n\\n\"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an\\nabomination.  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to\\nbe defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate\\nwith it; it is a perversion.\"  Lev. 18:22-23.\\n\\nI notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\\nverse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.  I know\\nof no New Testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention,\\nintercourse with animals.  Do those who argue for the legitimacy of\\nhomosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a\\nperversion, and if so, why?  That is, what verses would you cite to\\nprove that bestiality was perverted and sinful?  Could the verses you\\ncite be refuted by interpreting them differently?  Can one be a\\nChristian zoophile?\\n\\nBy the way, I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not\\nchoose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and\\nsinful, so please understand that I am not asking these questions out\\nof an antipathy towards my fellow \"people of alternative\\norientations\".  I do believe, however, that one should read the Bible\\nwith an attitude of \"what is the Bible trying to say\" and not \"what do\\nI WANT the Bible to say.\"  I choose not to give in to my \"perverted\"\\nsexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me, whether I\\nlike it or not, that such things are sin.  It is frustrating at times,\\nand I have had days where it really got me down, but I don\\'t blame God\\nfor this, I blame the sin itself.\\n\\n- Mark\\n\\n[There\\'s some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage\\nyou quote.  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that\\n\"homosexual\" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to\\nhave a meaning like homosexual prostitute.  That doesn\\'t meant that I\\nthink all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of the\\nevidence is such that you can\\'t just quote one verse and solve things.\\n\\nI think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why is\\nhomosexuality wrong?  Because it\\'s fornication.  Why is it\\nfornication?  Because they\\'re not married.  Why aren\\'t they married?\\nBecause the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony.  Why does the\\nchurch refuse to do a marriage ceremony?  Because homosexuality is\\nwrong.

       " u'In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks, \\nI came across something that was completely new to me, \\nand I thought I\\'d offer it for comment.\\n\\nTo keep this as brief as possible, let me state my \\nobservation as a declarative statement, and then whoever \\nwants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think \\nI\\'ve observed is that the phrase \"the Ten Commandments\", \\nas used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but \\nrather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. \\n20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase \"the Ten \\nCommandments\" should more accurately be translated \"the \\nTen Discourses\", of which the passage we call the \"Ten \\nCommandments\" is really only the first.\\n\\nI\\'m not completely convinced that the above is true, but \\nfor purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I \\nwas sure.\\n\\nArguments supporting the above idea:\\n\\n1)  There aren\\'t really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  \\nIn order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of \\nthem out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not \\nsupport such a division because they are all about not \\nworshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to \\nhave no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship \\nthe idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can\\'t violate \\nverses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that \\nthe whole passage is one command, and leaving us with \\nonly Nine \"Commandments\".  I could go on at length about \\nthis, but for now I\\'ll just stop with this summary.\\n\\n2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning\\nof the traditional \"Ten Commandments\") and Ex 31:18 \\n(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the \\nTen Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break \\nthese ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; \\n25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; \\n31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these \\npassages begins with some variation of the phrase, \"And \\nthe LORD spoke to Moses, saying...\"  The exception is \\nEx. 21:1, which begins \"Now these are the ordinances \\nwhich you are to set before them...\"\\n\\n3)  The word translated \"commandments\" in the phrase \\n\"the Ten Commandments\" isn\\'t really the word for \\n\"commandment\", its the word for a speech, or an \\nutterance.  It\\'s a word often used for longer discourses \\nrather than individual statements; for instance, when \\ncombined with the word \\'yom\\' (day), this word is \\ntranslated \"Chronicles\" in such phrases as \"now the rest \\nof the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the \\nChronicles of x?...\"  The word for \"commandment\" is \\nfreely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps \\nit is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X\\'s, \\nhe appears to have avoided the word for commandment and \\nchosen instead a word associated with discourses longer \\nthan just a single command.\\n\\n4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the \\nstone tablets \"with the law and the commandments\" (Ex \\n24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He \\nhas finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the \\nTen Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not \\nimmediately clear why God would wait several days and \\nnine more discourses before giving these tablets to \\nMoses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses \\nwritten on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that \\nGod would not give Moses the tablets until He had \\nfinished delivering all Ten Discourses.\\n\\n5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both \\ntablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If \\nthese Ten \"Commandments\" were only the first 17 verses \\nof Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE \\nletters!  Not that He couldn\\'t have, of course, but it \\ndoes seem more likely to me that this is a reference to \\ntwo tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-\\nsized letters.\\n\\n6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out \\nthe \"commandments written on stone\" as being the \\n\"ministry of death\", \"that which is fading away,\" and \\n\"the ministry of condemnation.\"  With the possible \\nexception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is \\ndifficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17 as being temporary, \"fading away\"-type \\ncommandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone \\ntablets should happen to have included all of the \\ncommandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.\\n\\nArguments against this idea:\\n\\nThe main argument against this idea, aside from the fact \\nthat it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that \\nin Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17, \"These words the LORD spoke...and He added \\nno more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and \\ngave them to me.\"  This appears to identify the words \\njust quoted as being the only contents of the two stone \\ntablets.\\n\\nThat was my first impression, anyway.  However, after \\nsome thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how \\nyou understand the phrase \"These words.\"  If Moses meant \\n\"These words *which I have just related to you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc., then that would mean that only the \\ntraditional \"Ten Commandments\" were on the stone \\ntablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical \\ncomment--\"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc.--then that\\'s quite different.\\n\\nI did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of \\nbeing given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the \\npeople asking Moses to represent them before God, \\nwhereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of \\nMoses between the first and second discourses, several \\ndays BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This \\nreinforces the idea that Moses\\' remarks in Dt 5:22ff \\nwere intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a \\nstrictly chronological account of when God wrote what, \\nand at what point He stopped adding to what was on the \\ntablets.\\n\\nSummary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more \\nlikely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only \\nthe first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses \\nof God.  I don\\'t know if anybody has ever espoused this \\nidea before; it\\'s brand-new to me.  So, while I lean \\ntowards accepting it, I would be very interested in \\nhearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to \\noffer.',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nThe Moderator of the General Assembly, the Rev. John Fife, visited our\\nchurch about a week ago (just 4 days after Rev. Spahr--it\\'s been a busy\\nweek for our small church!!).  He was asked specifically about the issue\\nof homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting next\\nmonth.  Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range\\nthe gamut from \"outlawing\" homosexuality altogether to \"legalizing\" it\\ncompletely.  He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult\\nissue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian church\\nsplit in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  Without\\nquestion, the issue may split the church again after we\\'ve been reunited\\nfor all of a dozen years or so.  He is hopeful that it will not and is\\npushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion\\nissue last year as a solution.\\n\\nHe is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the\\nmembers of the church \"Agree to Disagree\" on the issue, admitting that\\nboth sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead\\nthem to different conclusions.  It worked last year when the abortion\\nissue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that\\nthe GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree\\nwith their own view.\\n\\n--\\nCliff Slaughterbeck           | \\nDept. of Physics, FM-15       |   It\\'s time for the sermon on the\\nUniversity of Washington      |   Grand Torino!\\nSeattle, WA 98195             |',\n",

       " u'\\nIt might be interesting for folk to know that the Church of Scotland\\n(also a Presbyterian church)  managed to \"agree to disagree\" over\\nwomen\\'s ordination for 25 years.  The reasoning was that congregations\\nare free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessions\\nchoose elders.  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they\\nwere not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could not\\nbe forced to.  (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part\\nof the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th\\nAnnivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that very\\nissue, they didn\\'t get back together for almost 80 years).\\n\\nA couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens\\nordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all\\nministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  In\\ntheory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, or\\nrefused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could be\\ndisciplined.  In practice this has not happened, and I believe it is\\nunlikely to happen.  My personal view is that the new legislation was\\na mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation\\nworked very well.  \\n\\nWe are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years\\nassembly.

       " u'Regarding the consequences of the original sin:\\n\\nCatholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin, for\\nhimself and the human race, was sanctifying grace.  This is basically\\na share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk:\\nwhat God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.\\nIt makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers\\nof any possible creature.  This is the \"everlasting life\" that the New\\nTestament speaks of.\\n\\nWhat Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying\\ngrace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by\\nwhich this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.\\n\\nThe absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion\\nfrom Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it\\'s impossible for a\\nhuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying\\ngrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and\\nattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither\\ncan human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.\\n\\nThis all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since\\nboth have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot\\nenter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they\\ncannot enter into Heaven.\\n\\nTurning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the\\nCatholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some\\nchange in an infant\\'s soul, there is no particular reason to insist on\\nthe practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the\\nApostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly\\nthereafter.',\n",

A \"quick\\nlook\" doesn\\'t do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having\\nstudied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one\\nstage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying\\ntheological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.\\nThe clash between Jeremiah and the \"false prophets\" was primarily in\\nthe theological realm. The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship\\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David\\'s\\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David\\'s upon the throne and to never\\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\\nlocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic\\ncovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah\\nspoke his prophesies. The \"judgement prophesies\" were deeply loaded with\\ntheological meaning.\\n\\nIn my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson\\n\"New York will burn\" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic\\ntheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.\\n\\n--\\n                                                                     ___\\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nWell, here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a\\nsimilar question.  I hope it helps:\\n\\n[Begin repeat of previous post]\\n\\nAs for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a \\nproblem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.  \\nLuke\\'s version has Jesus saying that the children of this world \\nmarry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain\\nthe kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies\\none for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I\\nthink the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let\\'s have a\\nlook at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable\\nideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30,\\nMark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.\\n\\nWhat happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the\\nresurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to\\nthe \"Leverite\" marriage which required the brother of a man who died\\nwithout children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.  \\nThe children would be considered children of the deceased, just as\\nthough the woman\\'s first husband had fathered them.  It seems\\nobvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be\\nthe wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a\\nscene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to\\nfather children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite\\nmarriage was equal to the first for they ask, \"Whose wife shall she\\nbe in the resurrection?\"  At this point it seems obvious that if she\\nis anybody\\'s wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she\\nborne children they would have been credited to him regardless of\\nwhich brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was\\nrefering to this when he says, \"Ye do err, not knowing the\\nscriptures or the power of God.\" (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24,\\nphrase not in Luke\\'s account).\\n\\nAnyway, the Sadducees ask, \"Whose wife will she be in the\\nresurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?\"  Jesus answer is that,\\n\"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in\\nmarriage...\" (Mat 22:30) \"When they rise from the dead they neither\\nmarry...\" (Mark 12:25)  \"They which are accounted worthy to obtain\\nthat world neither marry...\" (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to\\nsay, \"but are as the angels in heaven\" or the equivalent.  I find\\nthis last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels\\nnor give any idea what their life is like.  (Some ministers claim\\nthat they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find no\\nBiblical support for this.)',\n",

Did it occur to you that I _don\\'t_\\nthink I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that\\nwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see\\n\"atheist\" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn\\'t deserve\\nyour respect?\\nAw, geez. I\\'m sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,\\nhere. It\\'s just that the \"nonsense\" thing really annoys me. I figure you\\nshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to\\nyour question.\\nNow, the smoothed feather version:\\nI seek all sorts of knowledge. That\\'s why I came to my university. Yes, I\\nam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of\\nChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.\\nI\\'ve been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don\\'t\\nknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists\\nI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist\\nmotives here all you want (hence the \"amatuer\" psychology crack), but\\nwithout an atheist, you can\\'t be sure of even one atheist\\'s motive.       \\nI\\'m hoping people really\\nwant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several\\nreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I\\nactually think about these things. Instead, I\\'m still faced with the\\nimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only \"broken\"\\npeople are atheist.\\n\\tTry it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural\\nstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many\\npeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they \\ndiscovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn\\'t\\nfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous\\nmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend\\nto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions\\nso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which \\n\"breaks\" people.\\nIt\\'s an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another\\nreason I\\'m here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as \\na watchdog for logical fallacies :).\\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe implication here being that atheists can\\'t possibly know anything\\nabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my\\nreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that\\natheists are \"broken\", hostile people. This post confirms that someone\\nelse believes it. \\n\\n                                             ^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWell, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of\\nevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies\\nlack of existence. However, I haven\\'t met the strong atheist yet who said\\nthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a \"seeker\" if you like, I\\ndon\\'t. \\n_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say \"I\\ndon\\'t believe in any god\" rather than my position: \"I believe that no\\ngod(s) exist.\" For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,\\nbecause they don\\'t actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is\\nconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and\\nMethodists from an atheist point of view :).\\nThis is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in\\nsomething (followed up by \"everyone has faith in something\"). Guess what?\\nMy atheism ends the moment I\\'m shown a proof of some god\\'s existence. Is\\nthat really too much to ask?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I guess you won\\'t succeed in converting him or me. Why the\\nsupposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is\\nit because you yourself are unconvinced? :) \\n\\nAnd I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that\\nI can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.\\nI have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that\\'s how I\\'m \"broken\"?\\nI tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that\\nyou should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a\\nfundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you\\nthink. All I ask for is proof of the assertion \"God exists\". Logical or\\nphysical proofs only, please. Then we\\'ll discuss the nature of \"God\".\\n\\nPrayer?!

       " u'[continuing with Dr. DeYoung\\'s article-]\\n \\n               SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\\n\\nD.S. Bailey\\n\\n     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who\\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\\nof \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\\npractice as evidence of perversion\" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term\\'s\\nreference in Paul\\'s works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\\nterm as \"homosexuals.\"  Bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual\\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in\\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt\\'s translation\\n\"sodomites\" best represents Paul\\'s meaning in Bailey\\'s judgment (39).  Bailey\\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\\n\\nJ. Boswell\\n\\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\\nsense.\\n\\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic\\nevidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male\\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\"  His argument is that the arseno-\\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make\\ntheir bed with, men.\"  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\\n(\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\\nas paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject\\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\\n\\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \\nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\\nwould be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\\narsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to Paul for a male\\nprostitute,\" since by Paul\\'s time the Attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and\\nporneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the LXX, had been\\nadopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\\nfornication.\"*7\\n\\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\\narsenokoitai \"did not connote \\'homosexual\\' or even \\'sodomite\\' in the time of\\nPaul\" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions\\nof homosexual relation\" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\\nomission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \\n\\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\\n\"circumlocutions.\"  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\\n(353).\\n\\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \\n\\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\\nreason\\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\\n\\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\\ndisapprove of \"gay inclination,\"  \"gay relationships,\"  \"enduring love between\\npersons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\"  (112, 166-17).\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________\\n4.

       " u'I get the feeling that we are debating at cross-purposes--that we\\ndo not see the same fundamental assumptions, and this perhaps makes\\nmy answers orthogonal to your questions.  I will try again.\\n\\nPerhaps you believe that nothing exists aside from objectively\\nobservable and provable things.  In that case, I cannot show you\\nthat there is such thing as a spirit or a spiritual need--these \\nthings do not exist in the realm of the objective, but in the\\nrealm of the subjective.\\n\\n(By a.a., I assume you mean Alcoholics Anonymous, and not alt.atheism ;)\\nI would not say that AA \"handles\" spiritual needs.  Rather I would say\\nthat AA (and other 12-step programs) help people come to terms with their\\nneeds--ie that AA is facilitating the recovery, and that as part of the\\nrecovery, they recognize their spiritual needs, and begin to rely on a \"higher\\npower\" (12-step\\'s term) to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse\\nthey had been accustomed to.  (Sorry, there is no objective proof here\\neither--no way to take 2 identical alcoholics and try to have one recover\\nby fulfilling spiritual needs, and one without and externally compare the\\ndifference--we are talking about the virtually infinite complexity of\\n*people* here.)\\n\\nSpiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition to\\nphysical requirements like air, food, sleep, etc.  These are things like\\nthe need for love and acceptance, and the need for meaning in life.  If \\none denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call \\nthese \"emotional needs\". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs \\nis that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual \\nmeans--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do \\nmany meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only be\\nsatisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people who\\naccept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since I\\nbelieve in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the others\\nare wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities:\\n\\n1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--ie\\nwe all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are \\ndeluded--they just haven\\'t recognized it yet.\\n\\n2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain\\nchemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do not\\nhave such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and \\nspiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.\\n\\nI hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritual\\nneeds cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existence\\nof God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjective\\nevidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I \\ncould venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that\\nI appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.\\n\\nI suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and\\ndemonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertion\\nis that such things are not objectively demonstrable.  As I have said before, \\nI myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism, having been pushed off the \\nfence by subjective evidence.

       " u\"The following was published in the May 15th Rocky Mountain News.  I\\nguess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at this\\nchurch.  I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor.  I also\\nunderstand that this is not an honest way to proceed.  Unfortunately,\\nthis is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming is\\nperceived to approach.\\n\\nThere is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at any\\ncost' style of theology.  I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits into\\nthis equation?\\n\\nBaptisms draw parents' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springs\\ntold they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religious\\nrite.\\n\\nBy Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau\\n\\nColorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured to\\na church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a\\nBaptist minister.\\n\\nDoxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by\\ntheir parents, thought they were going to a carnival at the\\nCornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight,\\nfree balloons, squirt guns and candy.\\n\\nBefore that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whisked\\ninto a room for religious instruction and told they should be\\nbaptized.  In many cases they consented, although they or their\\nfamilies are not of the Baptist faith.\\n\\nThe baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including\\nPaulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls\\nwho were baptized without her knowledge or consent.\\n\\n'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's a\\nfalse pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the minister\\ntold them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not\\nbaptized.\\n\\nCornerstone church officials defended their actions.\\n\\n'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded\\nus to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Bible\\nwhere it says that parental permission is required before a child is\\nbaptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist\\nChurch.\\n\\nChurch officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized\\nbecause 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said.\\n\\nMany other parents also felt they were simply sending their children\\nto a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were\\nmembers of the Cornerstone Church.\\n\\nPolice said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the\\nchildren, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------\\nAren't these the same behaviors we condemn\\nin the Hari Krishnas and other cults?\\n\\n[I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account\\nmentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent is\\nabsolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because of\\nthe clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insisted\\non being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willing\\nto do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrant\\nmuch careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so much\\nparental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether you\\nbelieve in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign\\nof entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from\\n*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of\\nthe Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it is\\nlikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from\\na baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he\\nwould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already\\nhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he get\\nrebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, he's being\\nrobbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.\",\n",

The founder of this\\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \\nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \\nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\\n\\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \\ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \\nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \\nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\\n\\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\\ntural backgrounds.\\n\\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\\n\\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement\\'s\\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\\n\\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\\none universal brotherhood.\\n\\n\\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \\n==================\\n\\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\\n\"NO/don\\'t create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \\n\\n\\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \\n====================\\n\\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\\nproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation\\nfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-\\ndo, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the\\nnewsgroup.

This means the\\nworld has had two perfect humans:  one died to take away the sins\\nof the world;  the other gave birth to Him?  I would certainly\\nwant to see some scriptural support for this before I would start\\npraying to anyone other than God.  Everything I have ever read\\nfrom the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless\\nLamb of God, not His mother, grandmother........\\n\\n: Hope this is useful to you.\\n\\nVery useful in helping me understand some of the RC beliefs.\\nThank you.',\n",

These people -- and those associated with them\\n    (\"Now there were with us seven brethren\", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\\n    ties; but that doesn\\'t mean other, more faithful people could not\\n    have this blessing.\\n\\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\\n    before then.\\n\\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\\n    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question\\n    was not significantly revised in the \"Joseph Smith Translation\" or\\n    \"Inspired Version\" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work\\n    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-\\n    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.\\n',\n",

If you would like more info on the ministry,\\nand/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial,\\ne-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.\\n\\n\\nLOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)\\n\\nby Malcolm Smith\\n\\nMoses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation\\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\\nthan God\\'s way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\\nat Kadesh and had God\\' s promise of one day entering the land. The\\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt\\'s gods as He led\\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What\\' s next on the miracle menu?\"\\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men\\'s lives had hung\\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God\\'s glorious\\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God\\'s love is not an emotion\\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\\nmother\\'s love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love\\'s excitement, a love\\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents\\' love is\\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents\\' love. It is a\\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God\\'s love will the rest of life\\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won\\'t\\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses\\' prayer was partially\\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man\\' s highest\\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nI think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams, \\nor dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign \\nthat he has something sinful in his heart.  It may be the Holy Spirit's\\nway of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that\\nwe can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a \\npure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy\\neven when he dreams.\\n\\nDreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples\\nof people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  \\n\\nRegarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be\\ncareful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially\\nif what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.\\nChristians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate\\nan out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE\\nmight actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE.\\nIn II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught\\nup into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really\\nleave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a\\nspirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters\\nthat much.  Paul could not tell.  \\n\\nBe that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan\\nto experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a \\nplace until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If\\nGod wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His\\nown sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are\\njust taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking\\nan OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was\\ncaught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some\\nJewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one\\ntime.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it.\\nPeople should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits\\nfor the sake of a few thrills.\",\n",

THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and\\nchildrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest\\ndegree mason every learns of.\\nI haven\\'t read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired\\napologist (can\\'t remember his name) on TV, didn\\'t exactly come to this same\\nconclusion.  \\n\\n\"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally\\nrepresented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented\\nvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity\\n-i.e. as a child in his mother\\'s arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, \\'the\\nson, the husband of his mother,\\' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \\nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, \\'The God of\\nFortification.\\'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\\ncelebrated as \\'the strong chief of the buildings.\\'  THis strong chief of the\\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\\nPlutarch, that \\'Osiris was black\\'.......\"  Hislop\\n\\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\\nrepented from \\'mysteries\\' of the lodge!)\\n\\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"To subdue.\"  It is a\\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\\ncow\".\\n\\nI\\'ll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\\nbe a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\\nMasonry doesn\\'t find its origins in Egypt.

       " u'This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a \\nsharing on the \"Johannine hours\" as proposed each month by the monks of \\nthe ecumenical community of Taize (pronounced te-zay) in France.\\n\\nNAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP: \\n==========================\\n\\nsoc.religion.taize (Unmoderated)\\n\\n\\nPURPOSE OF THE GROUP: \\n====================\\n\\nThe Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks \\nbased in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in \\ntheir life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a \\nsharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a \\nmonthly \"Johannine Hour\" which will be posted at the beginning of each \\nmonth. A \"Johannine hour\" involves a short commentary on a given Bible \\npassage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that \\nmay arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be \\nposted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less \\nin polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another \\nto deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own \\nlife-journey.\\n\\nThe idea of \"Johannine hours\" was born in Taize as a simple response\\nto all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible\\'s message in the\\nmidst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often\\nimpossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but\\neveryone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit\\nquietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,\\nwe can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of\\nChrist.\\n\\nDuring the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we \\nunderstand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, \\nwe find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to \\ncommunicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening \\nthem with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought \\nus joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.\\n\\nPerhaps those who read and think about the \"Johannine Hours\" in this\\nnewsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.\\n\\nThe important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the\\npersonal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect\\nof sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.\\n\\nBACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:\\n=================================\\n\\nThe following provides some background information on the life and\\nvocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.\\n\\n\"A PARABLE OF COMMUNION\": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of\\nWorld War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost\\nabandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring\\ntogether a monastic community which would live out \"a parable of\\ncommunity\", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of\\nthe time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal\\nrefugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.\\n\\nAN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize\\'s founder spent the\\nfirst two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,\\nseven brothers committed themselves together to common life and\\ncelibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each\\none making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.\\nToday, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant\\nbackgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are\\nliving in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North\\nand South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for\\nthemselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no\\ncapital. The brothers earn their living and share with others\\nentirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an\\ninternational Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live\\nin the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming\\npeople in Taize.\\n\\nTAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and\\nless young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since\\n1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have\\nthus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental\\nmeetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year\\nand they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any\\none week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore\\nthe roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner\\nlife and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to\\n6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and\\neverybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church\\nof Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too\\nsmall.\\n\\n\"A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH\" The community has never wanted to\\ncreate a \"movement\" around itself. Instead, people are called to\\ncommit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,\\ntheir city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created\\nwhat it calls \"a pilgrimage of trust on earth\". At the end of each\\nyear, the pilgrimage has a \"European meeting\" which brings together\\ntens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for\\nseveral days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia\\nand in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open\\nletter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the\\npoor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages\\nand provide themes for reflexion for the following year.\\n\\nNOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in \\n       news.groups.\\n\\nFor any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk\\n\\n               brother.roy@almac.co.uk',\n",

       " u'[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\\n\\nR. Scroggs\\n\\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\\n\\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell\\'s \"learned discussion\"\\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the \\'mistress\\' or who hires him on\\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\\naffirms (109).\\n     This is Scrogg\\'s interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \\nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\\n\\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\\nthe lists\" (104). \\n\\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\\nin today\\'s Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\\nrelevant to today\\'s debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\\n\\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\\n\\nD. Wright\\n\\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell\\'s\\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell\\'s treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \\nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell\\'s\\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\\n\\n     Wright also faults Boswell\\'s claims regarding linguistic features of the\\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\\ngender\" (132). \\n\\n     It is with Boswell\\'s treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \\nFor example, Aristides\\' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell\\'s discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \\n\\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\\n\\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\\n\\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\\n\\n     Wright next replies to Boswell\\'s contention that the term would not be\\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul\\'s letters or deliberately avoid citing\\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \\n\\n     Boswell\\'s treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright\\'s attention\\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom\\'s infrequent use of the term.  Wright\\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \\n\\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell\\'s limited\\nconclusion based on them.\\n\\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\\n\\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  ',\n",

       " u'RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992\\n\\n\\t\\tWHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE\\n\\nI. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\\n\\n\\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \\nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \\nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \\nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\\n\\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\\n\\n\\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\\nthe rapture until Christ\\'s second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob\\'s\\n(Israel\\'s) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel\\'s Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \\nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\\n\\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\\n\\n\\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \\n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \\npossession during the Tribulation.\\n\\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \\nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\\nunfold before you.  \\n\\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \\nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \\nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\\nsake of Christ.  \\n\\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\\n\\n\\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \\nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \\nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \\n\\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \\nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\\'s\\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \\nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \\nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\\n\\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \\nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \\nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \\ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\\nthe mark.  \\n\\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \\nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \\nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \\npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \\n14:9-10 \\n\\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \\n\\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\\n\\n\\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\\'s government\\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \\nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\\n\\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist\\'s control will come last to the least\\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \\nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\\nclosings\" --M] \\nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \\nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\\n\\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\\n\\t\\n\\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist\\'s\\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\\n\\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\\n\\n\\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \\n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \\nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \\npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \\npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\\n\\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \\nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\\n\\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\\n\\n\\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \\nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \\n\\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \\nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\\n\\n\\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\\n\\n******************************************************************************\\nMike Cluff\\t\\t\\t\\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\\t*  \\n******************************************************************************\\n\\n\\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\ \\n\\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \\n\\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.',\n",

       " u'genealogical \\nold \\n\\nWell, since my wife is (in your gentle term) a \"bastard\", I can\\nprobably speak with a bit of authority on this. Any \"stigma\"\\nassociated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests\\nsolely upon the parents--they\\'ve committed a sexual transgression for\\nwhich they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations\\non him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the\\nparents\\' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS\\ntheology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the\\nsubsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of\\nMormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases\\nholds parents responsible for their children\\'s sins if they have\\nfailed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this\\npassage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).\\n\\nAlso note that there is no \"big genealogical book in Salt Lake City\".\\nThe LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains\\ncontaining (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening,\\nbaptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. I\\nmay be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2\\nbillion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church is\\nbuilding up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is there\\nsome kind of \"worthiness screening\" as to whether someone can be\\nentered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who the\\nparents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database.\\n..bruce..\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBruce F.

       " u'\\nYou asked me to look over here, but I was on my way back anyway :-)\\n\\n#[reply to cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb)]\\n# \\n#>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? What\\n#>right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally\\n#>mandated morality?  Pardon the extremism, but couldn\\'t I murder your\\n#>\"brother\" and say that I was exercising my rights as I saw them, was\\n#>doing what felt good, didn\\'t want anyone forcing their morality on me,\\n#>or I don\\'t follow your \"morality\" ?\\n# \\n#I believe that morality is subjective.  Each person is entitled to his\\n#own moral attitudes.  Mine are not a priori more correct than someone\\n#elses.  This does not mean however that I must judge another on the\\n#basis of his rather than my moral standards.  While he is entitled to\\n#believe what his own moral sense tells him, the rest of society is\\n#entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is\\n#offensive to the majority.\\n\\nWhy?  Your last statement.  Why?  By which authority?  \\n\\n#Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral.  The may realize that\\n#it is immoral and not care.  They are thus not following their own moral\\n#system but being immoral.  For someone to lay claim to an alternative\\n#moral system, he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be\\n#internally consistent.  \\n\\nWhy?  Your last statement.  Why are these things necessary?  \\n\\nAnd believe me, a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly\\nconsistent.\\n\\n#Some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and\\n#thus may be incapable of behaving morally.  While someone like Hitler\\n#may have believed that his actions were moral, we may judge him immoral\\n#by our standards.  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean\\n#that we must excuse the murderer.\\n\\nTrouble is, this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler, too.\\n(I do *not* mean any comparison or offence, David.)   Try substituting \\nthe social minority of your choice for \\'sociopath\\', \\'Hitler\\',  and\\n\\'murderer\\'.  No logical difference.  Someone like you, vs. someone like\\nHitler. Zero sum.  \\n',\n",
       " u'Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Juan\\nGonzalez would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Juan\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 55.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nNixon, O.       34    12    15   .083    .777\\nGrissom, M.     48    18    12   .072    .812\\nJackson, D.     46    13    20   .060    .735\\nLewis, D.       25     8    -6   .029    .596\\nDykstra, L.     25     5    -5   .013    .794\\nDascenzo, D.    10    -5    10   .001    .616\\nFinley, S.      32    -2     2  -.003    .759\\nLankford, R.    39     4   -12  -.007    .844\\nMartinez, D.    21     5   -16  -.017    .660\\nVanSlyke, A.    30    -4   -17  -.040    .846\\nSanders, R.      7   -10    -4  -.059    .759\\nButler, B.       1   -29     5  -.088    .716\\nJohnson, H.      3   -12   -19  -.118    .548\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n.846 VanSlyke\\n.844 Lankford\\n.812 Grissom\\n.794 Dykstra\\n.777 Nixon\\n.759 Finley\\n.759 Sanders\\n.735 Jackson\\n.730 *NL Average*\\n.716 Butler\\n.660 Martinez\\n.616 Dascenzo\\n.596 Lewis\\n.548 Johnson\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nLofton, K.      57    32    17   .220    .947\\nWilson, W.      47    26     0   .125    .787\\nWhite, D.       52    25    28   .119    .812\\nFelix, J.       22     0    32   .063    .713\\nDevereaux, M.   43    16     0   .047    .832\\nMcRae, H.       38    11    -1   .038    .631\\nYount, R.       31     8    -3   .022    .737\\nKelly, R.       13    -6    -3  -.025    .681\\nJohnson, L.     23    -5   -13  -.040    .641\\nGriffey, K.     15    -9   -12  -.052    .844\\nPuckett, K.     13   -13   -15  -.063    .801\\nCuyler, M.       6   -10    -6  -.088    .503\\nGonzalez, J.     0   -21   -15  -.095    .738\\n\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.947 Lofton\\n.844 Griffey\\n.832 Devereaux\\n.812 White\\n.801 Puckett\\n.787 Wilson\\n.738 Gonzalez\\n.737 Yount\\n.713 Felix\\n.709 *AL Average*\\n.681 Kelly\\n.641 Johnson\\n.631 McRae\\n.503 Cuyler\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

His\\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\\n\\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\\nover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He\\'s an adequate OF,\\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\\nML level.

It still amazes me\\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\\nto 3B.  But maybe that\\'s because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is\\nscarce.\\n\\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don\\'t get\\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he\\'s been overdoing it these\\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\\nI\\'d much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\\ntrying hard enough.

Some restrict the term\\'s meaning to \"active male\\nprostititute,\" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\\nnamely \"homosexuals.\"  More recently the definition \"homosexual\" has been\\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\\n\"homosexuals\" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \\nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\\narsenokoitai by \"homosexuals\" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \\nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\\n\\n                      *************************************\\n\\n                                   INTRODUCTION\\n\\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \\nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\\n\\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\\nministry. \\n',\n",

Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families\\nconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten\\nof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and\\nwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect\\nman with soul, body and mind  ($  \\\\nu o  \\\\upsilon \\\\zeta $); He  was crucified,\\ndied, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the\\nHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all\\ncreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the\\nChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His\\nglory, according to the Scriptures.\\n\\n2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of\\nTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that\\nChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and\\nby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature\\nGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.\\n\\n3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by\\nuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which\\nHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,\\nwhich He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will\\nand energy.\\n\\n4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills\\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nare united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwithout  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthought alone.\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis\\nof the Logos Incarnate.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI guess that adresses your question adequately.\\n\\nAs for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the\\ndiscussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see\\nhow they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an\\nendless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a brief\\nanswer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church \\nregarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc.\\nis exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil',\n",

I ask those of you who call yourselves\\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\\nfor a long time to come.

Since\\nthis is now dated, however, don\\'t feel compelled to respond...\\n\\n\\nI suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have\\nbeen referring to; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition\\nlike this is what happens when a schism occurs, and over time certain\\nlarge and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor\\nexactly a \"face value\" interpretation...\\n\\n\\nWhile the context of the time is important, value judgments must\\nultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some\\nbase standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.).  This\\nis obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people,\\nfor instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were\\nimmoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look\\nrather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in\\nwhat way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is\\nsymbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of\\nwhose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By the\\nBible\\'s own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence\\nthat the followers of the various other religions of the area and time\\nwere particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.\\n\\n\\nSounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see\\nno support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane\\nneighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn\\'t mean that\\nthe actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, such\\ndehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or\\neven of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.\\n\\n\\nNote that I\\'m speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance\\nclaiming that Hammurabi\\'s \"an eye for an eye\" was primitive brutal\\nretribution, while Moses\\' version was an enlightened benign fine\\n(because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).  As\\nof 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t belittle the accomplishments, particularly the intellectual\\nones, of the Jewish people.  I have given up on trying to think by\\nanalogy, since I don\\'t know of any other \\'tribe\\' that is at all\\nsimilar (the closest I can think of are the Romany, but I don\\'t know\\nenough about them to make a meaningful comparison).

       " u'Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes.\\n\\n New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer\\'s Disease Discovered at\\nHuntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported\\n To: National Desk, Health Writer\\n Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or\\n          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research\\n          Institutes.\\n\\n   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing \\nand measuring chemical imbalances in the brain\\nwhich lead to Alzheimer\\'s disease and other dementias has been\\ndiscovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research\\nInstitutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research\\nwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,\\nRadiology.\\n   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\ncalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led\\nby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly\\npatients who were believed to be suffering from some form of\\ndementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special\\nsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical\\nProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses\\nin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton\\nMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination\\ntime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10\\nminutes.  By comparison, the current \"standard of care\" in testing\\nfor Alzheimer\\'s disease calls for lengthy memory function and\\nneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the\\npatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.\\n   In addition to Alzheimer\\'s disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\\nexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including\\nAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson\\'s disease and Huntington\\'s\\ndisease.\\n   \"We\\'ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickly\\nand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted\\nwith either the MRS or PROBE software,\" said Dr. Ross, adding,\\n\"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer\\'s earlier and\\nintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease\\ncauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.\"\\n   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the\\nbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker\\nin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed\\nwith Alzheimer\\'s showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their\\nlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was\\nsignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons\\nbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.\\n   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer\\'s disease is widely\\nconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross\\nbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer\\'s is caused by an\\ninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\\nthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\\nyears, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer\\'s were based\\non the changing receptors for acetylcholine.\\n   \"Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate\\nAlzheimer\\'s from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or\\nher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment\\nprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we\\nconsider this test a major advancement in medicine,\" said Bruce\\nMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher\\nand a co-author of the study.\\n   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,\\nPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,\\nR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200\\nGeneral Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,\\nand will be configured for other manufacturers\\' MRI units soon.\\n   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology\\nMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or\\nBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.\\n\\n   Q & A on Alzheimer\\'s Disease:\\n\\n   What is Alzheimer\\'s disease and how is it caused?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of\\nthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist\\nAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\\nmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\\nloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\\n   How many people does it affect?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\\nthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\\napproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer\\'s\\ndebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\\nemotionally and financially, for patients\\' families.  AD is the\\nmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\\nyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\\n   What are its signs and symptoms?\\n   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\\nbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\\nof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\\nyars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\\nto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\\nAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\\ndeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe \"forgetfulness\"\\ncaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School\\nof Medicine at New York University says \"whether forgetfulness is\\na serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree\" and\\nsuggests the following criteria:\\n\\n   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is\\n      normal.\\n   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.\\n   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.\\n   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.\\n\\n   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be\\nevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer\\'s disease and other forms\\nof dementia.\\n -30-',\n",

I agree that arrogance is not the result\\nof religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if\\nyou mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one\\'s\\nsuperior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person\\'s beliefs.\\n\\nI need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall\\ninto the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area\\nI hope you will forgive me.\\n\\nArrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that\\none\\'s God is greater than the god\\'s of others or of believing that one\\'s\\nreligion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied\\nbeliefs.\\n\\nIt is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong.\\nWere I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow\\nwhat I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs\\ncorrect.  That\\'s not arrogance.  That\\'s unavoidable behavior.\\n\\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person\\'s god to be greater than\\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn\\'t I be obligated to change so\\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\\n\\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\\nof one\\'s superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\\n\\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God\\'s work of creation in\\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\\n\"I\\'m not very smart.  I\\'m poor.  I\\'m not good looking.  I\\'m just a worm in\\nthe ground.  I\\'m such a weak person and although I don\\'t want to sin, I\\nreally cannot help it.\"  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\\ndifferent approach.  \"God, thank you for making me the way you did.

Lord, with all you\\'ve given me, I have been\\ncompletely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your\\nlove for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to\\nsave me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it\\npleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I\\'ve led.  Lord,\\nplease forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring\\nglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I\\'m so sorry for my wrongs.  Please\\nhelp me to change.\"\\n\\n: \\n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\\n: they don\\'t want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\\n: don\\'t have anything to do with them.\\n\\nFor me, I\\'ve often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\\nmost comfortable company.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don\\'t feel like\\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\\nmy wrongness, I\\'d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\\nhumility in private, I\\'d feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\\nin changing from the error of my ways.\\n\\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\\nIt isn\\'t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\\nto improve in one\\'s ability to serve God.  It\\'s easier to cast aside any hope\\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God\\'s creation\\nin our lives instead.\\n\\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\\n: over again by the words of others, you\\'d think we\\'d either toughen up\\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn\\'t make that\\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\\n: \\n\\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil\\'s aim is to get us\\ninto as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci-\\nless criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with\\nhot irons.

Someone tried to sell me a book in\\nLos Angeles airport entitled \"Easy Journeys to Other Planets\"\\nwhich uses such techniques.\\n\\nThe occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body\\ndeparture - the book \"The Challanging Counterfeit\", about a\\nformer medium who gets saved, tells how the author, on his last\\ntrance, was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him\\nwhile returning to his body at the end of the seance\\nbecause of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturally\\nprotected by the Lord.\\n\\nThere may be some similarities in mind-altering drugs and the\\nphenomena of \\'tripping\\'.\\n\\nAs regards the connection between body and soul, there is an\\ninteresting verse in Ecclesiastes. In a passage talking about\\nold age, the preacher writes \"Then man goes to his eternal home\\nand mourners go about the streets. Remember Him--before the\\nsilver cord is severed.\" (12.5-6) My understanding of this\\nsilver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul\\nin a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an\\nastronaut\\'s air-line to his spaceship.\\nWhen a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches\\nthe soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken:\\nastral projection can be dangerous!

It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \\nBut it can still be wrong. \\n\\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \\nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\\nplaying any part. \\n\\n\\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out.

I\\n   >would think not.  Hate begets more hate, never love.\\n\\n       If you are questioning whether or not \"hating sin\" is consistent with\\n   Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:\\n\\n       Romans 12:9 \"Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling\\n                    to what is good.\"\\n\\n       What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is\\n   calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would\\n   eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to\\n   do the opposite, to love your fellow man?\\n\\n   >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\\n   >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the\\n   >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so\\n   >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to\\n   >hate the sinner.\\n\\n       That has not been my experience.  I\\'ve not found myself hating anybody\\n   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner\\n   myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,\\n   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is\\n   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our\\n   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of\\n   the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;\\n   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to\\n   love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,\\n   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.\\n\\n   >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things\\n   >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe\\n   >what they are doing is a sin).\\n\\n       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the\\n   Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely\\n   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving\\n   for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most\\n   loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want\\n   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.\\n\\n   >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don\\'t\\n   >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and\\n   >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build\\n   >love.\\n\\n       Again, I don\\'t think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of\\n   the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified\\n   in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we\\n   can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and\\n   they will have rejected it.\\n\\n       Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we\\n   will, ourselves, be in sin.\\n\\n   >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our\\n   >neighbors. He doesn\\'t say anything about hate.\\n\\n       I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New\\n   Testament.  I really think that you will be surprised.\\n\\n   >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.\\n\\n       Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.\\n\\n   Hope this helps,\\n   In Christ,\\n   Tony Balsamo\\n--',\n",
       " u'\\nDavid, this study looks like a good one.  Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline \\nsearch and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since \\ncommercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or \\nbulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.\\nThis is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are \\nrecommended rather than yogurt.\\n\\nI guess the next question is why would this introduction of \"good\" bacteria \\nback into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the \\nanus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy\\ndenys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a \\nfacultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and \\ncolonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain \\nthe reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion \\nwas stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the \\nintestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida \\nlooses it\\'s major food source.\\n\\nGetting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is \\nnormally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal \\nyeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has \\nbeen used to get this effect but I\\'ve not seen any such treatment reported in \\nthe medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting \\ntheir own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their \\npatients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if \\never published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age \\nemerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the \\nmedical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to \\nhelp patients or does it look the other way.\\n\\nThis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous \\ntherapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But \\nthere are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty \\nhot and somebody could get burned.  It\\'s really tough.  Do I follow only \\nwell established protocols and then give up if they don\\'t work that well or \\ndo it try something that looks like it will work but hasn\\'t been proven to \\nwork yet?\\n\\nMy stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they \\ninvolve little or no risk to the patient.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\\n\\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\\nanything that\\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\\'d like to\\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\\n\\n\\n[7]  What\\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?\\n\\nMost people don\\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n',\n",

Whatever the\\n > thorn was, apparently it was not compatible with Christianity,\\n > yet does that make his epistles any less?\\n\\nPaul mentions his \"thorn\" (SKOLOPS, actually a sharp stake) in 2\\nCorinthians 12:7-9\\n\\n + And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of\\n + revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of\\n + Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. Three\\n + times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me;\\n + but he said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my\\n + power is made perfectr in weakness.\"\\n\\nHe does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral\\nproblem.  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He\\nordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and\\nhis signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says,\\n\"See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand,\" or else, \"See\\nwhat a long letter I have written with my own hand.\" If the former\\ntranslation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the\\nsmall script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters\\nlarger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the\\nGalatians (4:13-15),\\n\\n + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached\\n + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial\\n + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an\\n + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you\\n + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.\\n\\nPerhaps this last line means simply, \"You would have done anything\\nfor me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes).\"\\nBut in that case, we would expect some wording like, \"If I had\\nneeded them.\" \"If it were possible\" sounds as though the bodily\\nailment was connected with his eyes.\\n\\nWilliam Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific\\nsuggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he\\nhad been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had had\\na malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to\\nleave the low country and head for the hills. Malaria might well\\nhave given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.',\n",

       " u': Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the\\n: standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we\\n: can ask:\\n: 1. Is it authoritative?\\n\\n\"Authoritative\" is not a quality of the writing itself- it is a statement\\nby the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative.\\n\\n: 2. Is it prophetic?\\n\\nHow is \"prophecy\" to be defined? If it is \"speaking forth\" of God\\'s message,\\nmuch of the apocrypha must surely qualify.\\n\\n: 3. Is it authentic?\\n\\nAgain, by what standard?  Is \"authenticity\" a function of the authors? the\\nhistorical accuracy? \\n\\n: 4. Is it dynamic?\\n\\nWhat is this supposed to mean?  Many of the apocryphal books are highly\\n\"dynamic\" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting.\\n\\n: 5. Is it received, collected, read and used?\\n\\nBy whom?  Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some),\\ncollected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are,\\nin the Catholic and Orthodox churches).\\n\\n: On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\\n\\nThis is demonstrably false.\\n\\n: To quote Unger\\'s Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\\n: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\\n: anachronisms.\\n\\nSo do other books of the Bible.\\n\\n: 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\\n: which are at variance with sacred Scripture.\\n\\n\"False\" by whose interpretation?  Those churches that accept them find no\\ncontradiction with the rest of scripture.  \\n\\n: 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\\n: subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\\n\\nThis is a purely subjective evaluation.  The apocryphal books demonstrate\\nthe same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures.\\n(In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal \"Additions to the Book of\\nEsther\" act rather to bring the \"unscripturelike\" book of Esther more into\\nline with other books.)\\n\\n: 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\\n: Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\\n: poetic and religious feeling.\\n\\nHave you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon?  They\\nexhibit every bit as much \"poetic and religious feeling\" as Psalms or\\nProverbs.\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n: How do you then view the words: \"I warn everyone who  hears the\\n: words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to\\n: them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\\n: And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will\\n: take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the\\n: holy city\" (Rev 22.18-9)\\n: Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.\\n\\nThese words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone,\\nnot to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very\\nlate into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary\\nrole of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.\\n\\n: It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus\\' attitude. He had no\\n: argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John\\n: 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus \\n: that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the \\n: OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51\\n: taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say\\n: Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.\\n\\nJesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day,\\nthe canon had not been established as a closed collection.  The books\\nof the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of\\nthe early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e.\\nThe Torah (Pentateuch/ \"Law\") was established in Jesus\\' day, as were\\nthe Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however,\\nwere still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the\\nPsalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were all\\npart of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.\\n\\nTo argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51\\nis weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological\\nstory.  And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in the\\npresent order) did not exist as such in Jesus\\' day.',\n",

       " u'\\nWelcome.\\n\\n\\nHm. I get a little queasy around the phrase \"aren\\'t morally \\nresponsible\", perhaps because I\\'ve heard it misused so many times.\\n(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who\\nwas drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,\\nmost folk can\\'t control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I\\'m not sure what\\n\"actions\" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\\nour actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally\\nresponsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important\\npart of that.\\n\\nI don\\'t know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences. I\\'ve had dreams, some\\nfairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that\\nextreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably\\nmuch better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that,\\nthan to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by\\ndreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help.\\n\\nWhat on Earth is your definition of \"often\"? I know exactly one case of\\ntwo people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and\\nas they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could\\nsee why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only \"other plane\" I\\nknow of is the spiritual realm. I don\\'t think *anyone\\'s* dreams,\\nperhaps outside the occasional prophet\\'s, represent actual actions on an\\nalternate plane. If they were real actions, or conscious thoughts, then\\nyes they would have direct moral significance.\\n\\nin a different environment, then different moral laws apply\" is my guess of\\nwhat you said.]\\nI don\\'t see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones \"environment\"\\nchanges the way a person determines what is moral. For a Christian won\\'t\\nit *always* come down to \"what Jesus would have us do?\"\\n\\nTruth? I don\\'t claim to be an expert in dreams. I\\'ll note that the Bible\\ndoesn\\'t talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak\\nto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it\\nwarns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of\\nattention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.',\n",

According to Gammons,\\nadvanced scouts are reporting that Morris' fastball and slider still have\\nthe same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability\\nto keep the ball hidden during his release.  Guzman and Stottlemyre have\\ngone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a\\nlittle work with the pitching coach.  Gammons looks to see Morris back in\\ntop form within the month.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, still have my doubts.  Morris' ERA last year was\\nrather high for a pitcher who won 20 games.  His showing in the Series was\\nnot surprising.

You should\\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \\n complex instead. If you don\\'t (and there are some exceptions to that)\\n you\\'ll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \\n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \\n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\\n\\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \\n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \\n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100\\'s) in one day\\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\\n  \\n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that\\'s why they can\\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\\n\\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \\n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\\n \\n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\\n are big, and they don\\'t taste that great), a product made from pine \\n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\\n The name for the pine bark product is \\'Pycnogenol.\\'\\n  \\n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\\n \\n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \\n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \\n\\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\\n \\n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\\n\\n   -- Ron Roth --\\n =====================================================================\\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\\n\\n *   \"Eating Radium has strange results,\"  Tom said brightly.',\n",
       " u\"Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are \\nfinally moving in the right direction.  They should finish\\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \\nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\\n\\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \\n    but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield\\n    isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \\n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \\n    the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid\\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \\n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks\\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years\\n    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as\\n    before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan \\n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take \\n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that\\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the\\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\\n\\n2.  Wade Boggs.\\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \\n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\\n    Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about\\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\\n\\n3.  Spike Owen.\\n    See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\\n\\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\\n    Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think\\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing\\n    left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\\n\\nWhat I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \\nwill be ready in a year or two.  \\n\\nI'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\\nthem).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle\\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\\norganization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will\\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\\nexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is\\nstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all\\nenjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball\\nhell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!\",\n",

       " u'Someone referred to my FAQ essay on homosexuality.  Since it hasn\\'t\\nbeen posted for some time (and I\\'ve modified it somewhat since the\\nlast time), I\\'m taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another\\nentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They\\ncan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as\\npub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far\\nmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though\\nprimarily from a conservative point of view.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThis posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and\\nChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\\nit?\"\\n\\nFirst, on the definition of \\'homosexual\\'.  Many groups believe that\\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\\nterm \\'homosexual\\' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most \\'liberal\\' groups.  In\\nthis paper I\\'m going to use \\'homosexual\\' as meaning a person engaging\\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven\\'t heard of any\\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\\nremains celebate.\\n\\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\\nhomosexual.  This is often called a \\'homosexual orientation\\'.  It is\\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I\\'ve seen is that homosexuality is\\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\\nExodus International\".  The reports I\\'ve seen (and I haven\\'t read the\\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\\nPresbyterian Church\\'s infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\\nthat it\\'s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\\nthan the fact that it\\'s hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\\nit\\'s wrong, it\\'s wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\\nIf it\\'s very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\\nwilling to forgive it.\\n\\nOne more general background issue: It\\'s common to quote a figure that\\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\\nthis came from.  Here\\'s his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can\\'t\\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\\ninformation for Kinsey\\'s own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\\nat Rutgers:\\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A\\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey\\'s study, but the scholarly\\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\\n\\nI\\'ve seen some objections to the Kinsey\\'s study, but not in enough\\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\\nview, I\\'d be willing to include it.)\\n\\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\\nhave congregational government, you\\'ll find a few congregations that\\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\\nanother issue.  I don\\'t have any doubt that there are homosexual\\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\\n\\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here\\'s an\\nattempt to summarize the issues:\\n\\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\\n1980.\\n\\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\\n(There\\'s even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you\\'ll see that few\\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There\\'s a Jewish\\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\\nrate, there\\'s no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\\n\\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\\n\\nThe NT references are all in Paul\\'s letters.  A number of the\\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\\n\\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee\\'s commentary on I\\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\\nisn\\'t a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul\\'s writing is the first\\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn\\'t quite tell us the meaning, since it\\ndoesn\\'t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It\\'s dangerous to base\\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you\\'ll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\\nreligious expression because it\\'s based on \"God by with ye\".  However\\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\\ntheir translation).\\n\\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\\nwhat Paul meant.\\n\\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it\\'s homosexuality that\\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I\\'m sure Paul\\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\\n\\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\\nin passing.\\n\\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul\\'s negative view of\\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There\\'s not a lot I\\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\\n\\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\\nI\\'m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\\nquestion of whether Paul\\'s judgement should apply to modern\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\njudgements on these questions.\\n\\nAnother is the following: In Paul\\'s time homosexuality was associated\\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I\\'m\\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\\npartners.  (However Fee\\'s commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\\nin this paragraph shouldn\\'t be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\\ninvolve slaves or children.)\\n\\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\\nhomosexuality.  I\\'d like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\\nnot at risk for AIDS.\\n\\nNote that there is good reason from Paul\\'s general approach to doubt\\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\\nmarriage as what God ordained.\\n\\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\\n\\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\ntempted to fornication.\\n\\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\\nor whether you believe that it\\'s a misfortune that is in a broad sense\\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you\\'re willing to consider the latter\\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThis is going to depend upon one\\'s assessment of the inherent nature\\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\\n\\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we\\'ve\\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\\nthis situation.  I\\'ve also seen summaries of various research and the\\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there\\'s an FAQ that summarizes\\nour readers\\' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn\\'t happen,\\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\\nhomosexuality isn\\'t God\\'s original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\\nsuggests wasn\\'t part of God\\'s original ideal either -- I think such\\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God\\'s love\\nwith each other.\\n\\nThere\\'s an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\\nrelative?\\n\\nWhen looking at this issue, it\\'s worth noting that no one completely\\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\\n\\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\\n\\tthe OT -- it\\'s not in the NT, but I mention it here because\\n\\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\\n\\ton Christians)\\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\\n\\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\\n\\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\\n\\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\\n\\tbut not to our market economy.\\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\\n\\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\\n\\tconcerned about\\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\\n\\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\\n\\tan institution\\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\\n\\tRoman tax farming\\n\\nThe point I\\'m trying to make is that before applying Biblical\\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\\nor slaves of God.)\\n\\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\\nrelative.  Rather, I\\'m trying to say that *some* things are, and\\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\\naction we\\'re talking about now has the same moral implications as the\\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\\nhomosexuality are still binding, I\\'m willing to listen.  Those who\\nclaim that the question doesn\\'t need to be looked at are kidding\\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\\nall the rules listed above).\\n\\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\\ncan\\'t help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\\ndangerous situation for Christians.\\n\\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\\ndon\\'t see it as an argument for acceptability.',\n",

       " u'Sorry about the delay in responding, due to conference paper deadline panic.\\n\\n\\n[Alarming amounts of agreement deleted :-)]\\n\\n\\nThat (\"complicated\") isn\\'t in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it\\'s more\\nthe other way around. It\\'s from\\n\\n  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG\\')  where G\\' is the complement of G\\n\\nand by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG\\') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).\\n\\nIn a sense, HG is necessarily more \"complicated\" than H for any H and G,\\nso I may be splitting hairs, but what I\\'m trying to say is that irrespective\\nof subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG)\\nholds, with equality if and only if P(HG\\') = 0.\\n\\n\\nWell, \"P(x | A) = P(x | B)\" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is\\noperative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not\\nprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between\\nthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference\\nreduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior\\nprobabilities P(A) and P(B):\\n\\n  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>\\n\\n    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)\\n\\nwhere k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).\\n\\nSo A and B are \"equally consistent with the data\" in that observing x\\ndoesn\\'t give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.\\n\\nIn the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their\\nprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don\\'t know\\nthe actual values, and it\\'s this which allows us to deploy the Razor to\\nthrow out any such HG.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or\\nnot a `divine component\\' actually underlies the prevalence of religion\\nin addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious\\nimplicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word\\'.\\n\\nNow it seems to me, as I\\'ve said, that the observed variance in religious\\nbelief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather\\n*less* well if one proposes a `divine component\\' in addition, since I would\\nexpect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual\\nexclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn\\'t\\neven equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,\\nG is `divine component\\', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily\\nacknowledge that this is a subjective impression.\\n\\n\\nNot that I\\'m a statistician as such either, but:\\n\\nThe idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of\\nthe (read `my\\') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with\\nwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be\\nanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable\\nto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in\\nmeasurable ways.\\n\\nThis means that these regions of the space of possible observations, \\nwhich I loosely termed \"appearances of god/s\", have some nonzero\\nprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.\\n\\nSince there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to\\nscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism\\nexpends on making \"appearances of god/s\" possible must come from somewhere\\nelse (i.e. other possible observations).\\n\\nAll else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn\\'t* an\\n\"appearance of god/s\" must have a slightly higher probability under\\natheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such\\nobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability of\\nthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease\\nin my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.\\n\\nSorry if that\\'s still a bit jargonesque, but it\\'s rather difficult to\\nput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties\\nof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total\\narea under them is always unity.\\n\\nAn analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is \"the\\ncoin is fair\", and that B is \"the coin is unfair (two-headed)\". (I\\'ve\\nused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)\\n\\nThen\\n\\n  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1\\n  P(T | A) = 0.5  }\\n\\n  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1\\n  P(T | B) = 0    }\\n\\nThe observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible\\nwith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability\\nexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they\\ndon\\'t actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must\\nbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance\\nof heads.\\n\\nSay our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The\\nobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are\\nmodified according to\\n\\n                            P(H | A)\\n  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nand\\n\\n                            P(H | B)\\n  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nNow we don\\'t know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but\\nthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time\\nthe coin is tossed and a head is observed.\\n\\nThus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have\\n\\n                 n\\n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)\\n\\nand\\n                    n\\n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),\\n\\nand since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1\\nand thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must\\ndecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must\\nincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.\\n\\nThe loose analogy is between \"unfair coin\" and atheism, and between \"fair\\ncoin\" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which\\nwould falsify \"unfair coin\", is analogous to an \"appearance of god/s\",\\nwhich would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends\\nto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle\\nis the same.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuite so, but this type of theism is what I might call \"the G in the HG\",\\nin terms of our Ockham\\'s Razor discussion, and I\\'d bin it on those grounds.\\n\\n\\nThe hypotheses don\\'t have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model\\',\\nthe theism isn\\'t falsifiable.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to. We don\\'t need, in the above analogy, to know *any*\\nprior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the\\nfair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding\\nmultiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.\\nYou don\\'t need to know the initial values of the running estimates\\neither. It\\'s clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)\\napproaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.\\n\\nAll you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for\\nobserved x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain\\nevents rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible\\nunder Ha, and all else is equal.\\n\\n\\nAny observations you like; it really doesn\\'t matter, nor affect the\\nreasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which\\nwould count as \"appearances of god/s\". Examples of this might be\\na demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of\\nrevelation.\\n\\n\\n\\nOK, we\\'ll downgrade \"*does* interact\" to \"*may* interact\", which would\\nactually be better since \"does interact\" implies a falsifiability which\\nwe both agree is misplaced.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll explain, but bear in mind that this isn\\'t central; all I require of\\na theism is that it *not* make the prediction \"Appearances of god/s will\\nnever happen\", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum\\nmechanics doesn\\'t make this prediction either, the difference is that\\nQM and atheism do not form a partition.)\\n\\nPredictions include such statements as \"Prayer is efficacious\" (implying\\n\"If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious\"), or \"Prayer\\nis *not* efficacious\", or \"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not\\npass, till all these things be fulfilled.\" I don\\'t think we have any problems\\nof misunderstanding here.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s fine; I don\\'t claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite\\nnumber of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and\\nthat as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think you are; an \"appearance of god/s\" is sufficient to falsify\\natheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.\\n\\n\\nNo: by way of a counterexample, let X = \"the coin is fair\", or more\\naccurately (so that not(X) makes sense) \"the two sides of the coin are\\ndifferent\". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of\\nheads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite\\nnumber of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable,\\nand is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOops. Sorry. Mea culpa.\\n\\n\\nWe agree here.\\n\\n\\n\"The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992.\" Said Rapture would have\\nfalsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened, although its failure\\nto happen does not, of course, falsify any theisms other than those which\\nspecifically predicted it.\\n\\n\"No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its\\nexplanation will ever be observed.\" That about sums the whole thing up.\\n\\n\\nCheers\\n\\nSimon',\n",

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\\n\\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \\n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\\n\\n  Contact:\\n  Rodney Hoinkes\\n  Head of Design Applications\\n  Centre for Landscape Research\\n  University of Toronto\\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\\n\\n==========================================================================\\n\\nEnd of Resource Listing',\n",

       " u'\\nIndeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:\\n\\n  26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often\\n  since the foundation of the world; but now once at\\n  the consummation He has been manifested to put away \\n  sin by the sacrifice of Himself.\\n\\n  27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die\\n  once, and after this comes judgement;\\n\\n  28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear\\n  the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to\\n  bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.\\n\\n\\nThe first point is that this verse is part of an even larger\\ncontext, the subject of which is not the destiny of the\\nindividual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ\\'s\\nsacrifice, \"once\", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen \\nmankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his \\n\"Christianity and Reincarnation\".  The thrust of the passage\\nin its context is to liken the one time incarnation and \\nsacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual \\nexperience of the human being after death.  The \"once\" \\nis repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity \\nof Christ\\'s deed.  One thing for certain it does is to \\nrefute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than \\nonce.  But the comparison to the human experience - die \\nonce, then judgement (note: not \"the judgement\", but just \\n\"judgement\".  The word for judgement is \"krisis\".\\n\\nHebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense\\nof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this\\npoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages \\nthat (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably\\nthey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial\\nof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of\\nHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,\\nnamely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after\\ndeath.\\n\\nWhat should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially\\nsilent about the fate of the individual human being between death\\nand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly\\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\\n\\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\\nand \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\\n\\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \\nworks, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the\\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \\nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \\nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\\n\\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \\ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \\ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \\nnot the end of man\\'s sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and\\nthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.',\n",
       " u\"\\nI would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which\\nideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus.  In the real world\\n(tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock\\nthemselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those\\npeople who are of the same opinion as they are.
